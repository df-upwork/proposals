1) The error message indicates that the system insists on using the form with ID 62.
This system inflexibility indicates that your suspicion is most likely correct: the issue is highly likely caused by a script or a workflow.
Scripts and workflows are often used for dynamically selecting forms and lead to fatal errors that halt the transaction.
2) If it is guaranteed that the scripts and workflows have not been changed, then the most probable cause of the issue becomes hypothesis #2: the deactivation or deletion of the form specified in the diagnostic message (#62).
In my experience, this is the most common reason for this type of issue.
I ranked hypothesis #1 higher only because you give the impression of an experienced user and have already tried to find the cause of the issue on your own, whereas in the case of hypothesis #2 the cause is too obvious.
3) I have a few more hypotheses, but they are much less likely than the ones described above.
