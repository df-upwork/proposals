1) The developer of your PHP script may have mistakenly assumed that «successful upload» means calling `POST /feeds/2021-06-30/feeds` (`createFeed`) and receiving `feedId` in the response.

2) However, Amazon processes feeds asynchronously: after a certain amount of time following the upload, Amazon creates a «Feed Processing Report» which informs you whether Amazon has accepted your feed. 
3) Accordingly, after `createFeed` it is necessary to wait for the «Feed Processing Report», retrieve it, and then interpret it correctly:
3.1) Request the processing status periodically: `GET /feeds/2021-06-30/feeds/{feedId}`
https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/feeds-api-v2021-06-30-reference#get-feeds2021-06-30feedsfeedid 
3.2) In the response, Amazon will return a `Feed` object.  
For this object, track the value of the `processingStatus` field: https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/feeds-api-v2021-06-30-reference#processingstatus  
3.2.1) As long as the value is `IN_PROGRESS` or `IN_QUEUE`, repeat point 3.1 periodically.
3.2.2) The other 3 possible values are: `DONE`, `CANCELLED`, and `FATAL`.
Again, `DONE` does not mean that the feed is a «successful upload»: this status only means that Amazon has finished processing the feed.
4) To analyse `DONE`, `CANCELLED`, and `FATAL`, use another field of the `Feed` object from point 3.2: `resultFeedDocumentId`.
4.1) Call the `GET /feeds/2021-06-30/documents/{resultFeedDocumentId}` endpoint:
https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/feeds-api-v2021-06-30-reference#get-feeds2021-06-30documentsfeeddocumentid
4.2) The response will be a `FeedDocument` object: https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/feeds-api-v2021-06-30-reference#feeddocument
Use the `url` field from it — this is the «Feed Processing Report» URL.  
This report will list all the errors of your feed. 
5) I can implement proper feed submission to Amazon in your PHP script.
I have been working in eCommerce programming for the last 15 years (mostly Magento — the largest and most feature-rich eCommerce platform on PHP) and I know all the proper eCommerce processes.
