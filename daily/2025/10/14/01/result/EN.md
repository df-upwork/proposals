Your misconceptions:
1) «none of these three ways allow you to send your calendar back to them to block out time slots»
1.1) On the official Greenstone website, «Google Calendar integration» is clearly stated: https://www.greenstoneapp.com/dashboard
It is also claimed that their calendars help maintain synchronization «without double bookings».
This implies two-way synchronization.
1.2) GetMyBoat supports Google Calendar import: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWgG4U1l3WU
2) «No one in the charter industry has been able to figure out a way to automate this»
The technology to solve this problem has long existed and is widely used not only in the charter business, but also in related industries (hospitality, rentals).
It is called «Channel Manager».
An implementation example for the charter business: https://web.viewyacht.com/post/charter-channel-manager-api
