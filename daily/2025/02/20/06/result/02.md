1) In the U.S., you have no tax liability at all.
Under the terms of the «Double Taxation Taxes on Income Convention Between the United States of America and Australia» (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/aus.pdf, hereinafter referred to as the Convention), if there is no «Permanent Establishment» (PE) in the US, the business profits received by an Australian resident are not subject to US taxation.
That is, the withholding rate in the US will be 0%, and taxes are paid in Australia.
2) According to paragraph 1 of Article 5 («Permanent Establishment») of the Convention, a «permanent establishment» (PE) means «a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on».
The use of Amazon (FBA) warehouses by itself does not create a PE for the seller if there are no employees, offices, or other substantial presence in the US.
Consequently, when you sell through Amazon from Australia (without an office, employees, etc. in the US), you do not have a PE in the US.
3) According to Article 7 («Business Profits») of the Convention: «the business profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein».
That is, if you demonstrate (through Form W-8 BEN) the absence of a PE in the US, then all profits from such activity are taxed only in Australia, and the 30% tax at source in the US is not withheld.
4) By default (without confirming nonresident status and the absence of a PE), 30% may be withheld from foreign persons — this is the standard «withholding tax» for nonresidents.
When the W-8 BEN is correctly completed, referring to Article 7 of the Convention, the taxpayer asserts the right not to be taxed in the US on business profits.
As a result, Amazon does not have the right to withhold tax, since (under the Convention) such profits are taxed only in Australia.
5) The US Tax Code («Internal Revenue Code») allows one to reduce or eliminate the withholding tax rate through Form W-8 BEN under «tax treaty benefits» (26 CFR §1.1441–1 et seq.).
6) The IRS «Instructions for Form W-8 BEN» (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw8ben.pdf) explicitly state that if the income received qualifies for benefits under an international convention (treaty), it is necessary to complete the «Claim of Tax Convention Benefits» section and indicate the relevant article of the treaty and the applicable rate.
