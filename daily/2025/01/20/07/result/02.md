In my experience, your problem is caused by one of the following 5 reasons:
1) If Cloudflare is configured for Flexible SSL while the backend (Traefik) expects full TLS, it can break the HTTPS handshake.
2) If Traefik uses a self-signed certificate or a Cloudflare Origin certificate, but it is not trusted, Cloudflare can reject the connection.
3) There may be errors in the routing rules, missing or invalid TLS-secret, or incorrect `entryPoints`.
4) Cloudflare supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3 by default.
If Traefik (or your configuration) attempts to use TLS 1.1, then the handshake will fail completely.
5) The host name (SNI) in the TLS handshake and the domain specified in the certificate must match. 
If a wildcard certificate is used (for example, `*.example.com`) but the request goes to `example.com` (apex / naked domain), the handshake will fail.
