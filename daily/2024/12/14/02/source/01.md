From all the replies I got on my question, your answer is the only one that makes me believe you have the required knowledge and fully understand what we need.



Our webshop is bouwkampioen.be and right now we use price2spy (since a long time). However, they are a bit outdated, requiring a lot of our time to add/update url's, and no decent price updating objects, and from my short analysis I did on google, it might be worth looking into new technology to support our requirements.



We are a relatively small business and do not require the most sophisticated software, but main goal is to (after configuration) make price tracking configuration (adding urls and matching with competitors) + reporting as automatic as possible, with ML, and if possible also an easy way to implement price changes (now we have to manually update in our M2 backend).



You also list the highest rate/h in your profile. Are you also comfortable with a fixed price for the project? Depending on the budget, we could run the sales process ourselves and keep you in the loop for set-up and configuration, or we could ask you bundle our wishes, check our current environment and approach minderest or competera (or other) for a quotation & demo? I don't know what you prefer and what other information you would need from me in order to make some proposal? Thanks a lot already for the introduction.
