1) Both structures considered by you are not the best for solving your task.
In points 3 and 4 I outline their main disadvantages.
1In point 5 I outline a much higher quality structure in your case.

2) Key designations in my analysis:
Malta: `M᛭`
Cyprus: `C᛭`
USA: `U᛭`
Cyprus Holding: `CHᨀ`
Malta Consolidated Group (Fiscal Unit): `MHᨀ`
Malta Trading Ltd: `MTᨀ`
Your US LLC: `Uᨀ`
Your proposed structure «`CHᨀ` + `MTᨀ`»: `CH⧟MT`.
Your proposed structure «`MHᨀ` + `MTᨀ`»: `MH⧟MT`.

3) Disadvantages of `CH⧟MT`
Registration of `CHᨀ` as the «Principal Taxpayer» in `M᛭` combined with the management of the company by you (residing in `M᛭`) creates irrefutable grounds for recognizing the place of effective management in `M᛭`.
In accordance with the tie-breaker rules in the Double Taxation Treaty between `M᛭` and `C᛭` (Article 4(3)), `CHᨀ` will be recognized as a tax resident of Malta.
This will lead to the complete loss of the advantages of the Cyprus jurisdiction and the taxation of the worldwide income of `CHᨀ` in `M᛭` at a rate of 35%.

4) Disadvantages of `MH⧟MT`
4.1) Using `MH` with the payment of 5% tax results in the distributed profit being classified as originating from the «Untaxed Account», since the full 35% tax was not paid.
According to Article 61 of the Income Tax Act, dividends paid from the «Untaxed Account» in favor of a resident individual (which you are) are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15%.
This increases your effective tax burden from the expected 5% to 19.25%, making `MH⧟MT` economically unfeasible.
4.2) Within `MH`, the income generated by `MT` is legally attributed to the «Principal Taxpayer» and is classified as income arising in `M᛭` (ITA, Article 4(1)(a)).
For you as a resident shareholder of `M᛭`, this means that dividends from such a structure lose the status of «foreign income» and cannot be taxed on the Remittance Basis.
«Tax shall be charged… upon that income… arising in Malta» (ITA, Article 4(1)(a)).
Such dividends are subject to full declaration and taxation in `M᛭`, regardless of which account (Maltese or foreign) they are paid to.
4.3) You lose the method of protecting your assets from direct claims via a foreign holding.

5) A high-quality strategy for solving your task
5.1) Essence: `CH⧟MH⧟MT`
5.2) Implementation:
`CHᨀ` must own 100% of `MHᨀ` shares.
`MHᨀ` and `MTᨀ` form an internal fiscal unit, allowing the payment of consolidated tax at a rate of 5% immediately.
`Uᨀ` is transferred to the balance sheet of `MTᨀ`, which allows using the `U᛭`-`M᛭` Agreement to reduce taxes in `U᛭` subject to passing the LOB test via your Italian citizenship.
Profit, cleared of taxes (95%), is distributed from `MHᨀ` to `CHᨀ` without withholding taxes in `M᛭`.
You receive dividends from `CHᨀ`, which qualify as foreign source income and are not subject to tax in `M᛭` under the Non-Dom regime in the absence of remittance.
5.3) Advantages
5.3.1) Simultaneous achievement of corporate liquidity via the payment of 5% tax without delays and personal tax efficiency with 0% tax on dividends.
5.3.2) Legal isolation of `CHᨀ` from `MH⧟MT`, which minimizes the risk of `CHᨀ` being recognized as an `M᛭` resident based on place of management.
5.3.3) Creation of a protected investment perimeter at the level of `CHᨀ`, which facilitates access to Swiss banking for capital accumulation.
5.3.4) Full legitimacy of using the 5% rate in `M᛭` combined with asset protection through a foreign jurisdiction.
