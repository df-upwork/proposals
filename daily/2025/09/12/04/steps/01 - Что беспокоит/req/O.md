Logistics and Shipping Specialist


I own a factory in Lviv Ukraine manufacturing women’s dresses. 
I am looking for someone to assist on a regular basis with logistics and shipping. 
I currently have a fully functioning factory manufacturing 70 - 100 dresses per week and we are growing rapidly, we expect to double this by spring next year.

I have a business consultancy who provide all legal and accountancy advice, however I am looking for someone with experience in Logistics and shipping / imports and exports to help navigate this complex area. I already have relationships with my suppliers, who supply my UK production, however I need this supply to now come into Ukraine for Production

Main duties:

Finding the most cost efficient shipping services to export goods in smaller shipments of approx 50 dresses at a time , shipments may be larger in the future, however we are currently working on gaining preferential origin for the goods produced and receiving EUR1. The exports must be official and generate the correct paper work, such as bill of lading / air waybill needed for accounting. Shipments will need to be made on a regular basis - weekly. This is the first stage of our exports, shipping goods to my UK warehouse.

For the long term we will look to ship individual dresses direct to customers from Ukraine. Options are direct shipping or consolidation. - I have a company in mind for this in Ukraine who consolidate shipments to UK, USA and Europe (Our sales are 85% to USA, 5% to UK , 5% to Europe, 5% to Australia). I need to understand if they can generate the correct paperwork as needed by accounts to verify the export.

Assisting with imports from Turkey and China. Currently we have shipments from Turkey set up, however I am still looking at ways to ship from China cost efficiently. I am looking for companies with consolidation from Guangzhou to Ukraine - I do have a contact for this, however need a Ukrainian speaker to communicate with.

Generally being an intermediary for myself (English speaking only) and a customs agent / broker and shipper. Also advising on and assisting with the complex nature of the Ukrainian legislation in terms of exports and imports.


In summary I am looking for an experienced logistician who can implement a smooth and reliable supply chain of import and exports, whilst helping to educate me as to the complexities of the Ukrainian legislations around importing and exporting.

This is a long term ongoing project.

HS code to qualify for 0% duty

```text
I am looking for someone to assist with determining the HS code and preferential origin status of an import from Ukraine to UK of women's dresses - synthetic fibres. I am looking at obtaining pref origin to receive 0% duty.


The goods to be imported, i believe should be under the HS code womens dress - synthetic fibres  but then will not qualify for pref origin, unless they can be proved as made up of maximum 40% non originating materials. I do not have the EUR1's for the originating fabrics, so am finding it hard to prove this.

I am looking to find a way to prove origin for preferential 0% duty or finding a HS code that could be used

I am looking for someone to assist with determining the HS code and preferential origin status of an import from Ukraine of women's dresses - synthetic fibres. I am looking at obtaining pref origin to receive 0% duty.

The goods to be imported, i believe should be under the HS code womens dress - synthetic fibres  but then will not qualify for pref origin, unless they can be proved as made up of maximum 40% non originating materials. I do not have the EUR1's for the originating fabrics, so am finding it hard to prove this.

When I look on .gov online tariff support - the ruling states that the if the product is 'Women's, girls' and babies' clothing and clothing accessories for babies, embroidered' (embroidered being a separate classification, but not a separate HS code)- the requirement becomes 'Manufacture from unembroidered fabric, provided that the value of the unembroidered fabric used does not exceed 40% of the ex-works price of the product.'

I am looking for clarification on the classification of the 'embroidered' part of this section as there does not seem to be a specific HS code that defines womens dress  - synthetic fibres  as embroidered.

The dresses are made of fabrics which are then embroidered in Ukraine as part of the processing into dresses, so does this qualify, if so how is it proven?

In summary I am trying to make sense of how to import these goods as 0% duty, if at all possible
