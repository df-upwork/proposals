While surcharges are generally permissible under `L`, they cannot be used to authorize a discharge that causes «interference» (hereafter — `I`) with the POTW.
The extreme characteristics of your wastewater (pH 11-12 and BOD ~70,000 mg/L) meet the textbook definition of `I`.

`I` is legally defined (40 CFR 403.3(k)) as a discharge that both (1) inhibits or disrupts the POTW and (2) consequently causes the POTW to violate its own permits.
The extreme characteristics of your wastewater (pH 11-12 and BOD ~70,000 mg/L) are virtually certain to cause `I`.
