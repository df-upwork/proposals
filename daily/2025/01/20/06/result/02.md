In my experience, your problem is caused by one of the following 5 reasons:
1) There could be a misconfiguration in the settings (a mismatch in the Kubelet manifests or in the Deployment/StatefulSet definitions).
2) Auto-scaling settings, limits, and requests at the Kubernetes level may have been broken.
3) When increasing memory limits, packages or VM/GCE images may have been updated, resulting in incompatibility with the current version of Kubernetes.
4) When increasing memory limits, the system may have required a node restart with an updated kernel or additional modules, resulting in incompatibility.
5) If it is not GKE (but a custom Kubernetes on GCP or bare metal), then when upgrading memory, it is often necessary to reconnect the node to the cluster, especially if its IP, hostname, or kubelet configuration has changed.
