Azure Data Factory pipelines  

## Description
I joined a new company last month in the UK.  
I have been tasked to understand why some Azure Data Factory pipelines have not been working.   
Now why am i here? I cannot even test the pipeline.   
I wanted to run the pipeline but because it is a parameterised pipeline, i just don't know how to go about it.   
I want someone to look at the pipeline, tell me what it is doing and then show me how to run it or test it.
