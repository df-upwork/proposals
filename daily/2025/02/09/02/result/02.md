1) Since you need to perform administrative operations, you need «User authentication» (not «API key authentication»): https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/types-of-authentication/#user-authentication
2) «User authentication» works like this:
2.1) First it is necessary to make a request `POST /webadaptor/sharing/rest/generateToken` and receive a token: https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/users-groups-and-items/generate-token
2.2) Then the token 2.1 is used to call `/admin/` routes of ArcGIS Server, for example:
```
https://<server>/arcgis/rest/admin/services/ServiceName.MapServer?f=json&token=<your_token>
```
