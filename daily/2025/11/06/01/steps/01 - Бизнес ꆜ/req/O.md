## 2.3. Description
`PD` ≔ 
```text
# Objective
We need to build an automated link between our packaging artwork in Adobe Illustrator and an external XML (or similar structured data) source, so that product information such as ingredients, nutrition panels, names, and claims can be updated automatically, without manual text edits.

The final outcome should allow:
- Dynamic content updates pulled from a single data source (XML, CSV, or API).
- Style consistency (font, size, color) retained when data changes.
- Error handling for overflow and missing fields.
- Templates ready for print with minimal manual intervention.

We’re open to any proven method that achieves this goal, whether it’s using Esko Dynamic Content, ExtendScript (Illustrator scripting), or another data-driven automation workflow.

# Key Requirements
- Map key text fields (product name, ingredients, nutrition info, claims, flavour, usage) to a live data source.
- Support live data refresh or easy re-linking to an XML/CSV feed.
- Maintain Illustrator text styles and layout during updates.
- Handle overflow or missing data gracefully.
- Deliver documentation so our design team can update and reuse templates.

# Deliverables
- Working Illustrator Template (.ai / .ait)
- Dynamic text fields linked to XML/CSV data
- Tested with a sample feed
- Documentation (2–3 pages)
- How to link/update data
- Common troubleshooting and error handling

# Optional
- Script or automation file (if Esko isn’t used)
- Recommendations for best-fit workflow for long-term scalability

# What We’ll Provide
- Sample packaging Illustrator file (e.g. PERFORM Vanilla 936g pouch)
- Sample XML/CSV structure with real content
- Brand fonts, styles, and layout guidelines

# Ideal Candidate

We’re looking for someone who can design smart, scalable automation for packaging workflows.
Relevant backgrounds could include:
- Illustrator scripting / ExtendScript / UXP automation
- Variable data or data-driven design workflows (InDesign, Illustrator, Esko, etc.)
- XML / JSON / API data integration
- Workflow documentation and QA
