Overview
We seek a senior tax/social-security advisor with strong Germany–Spain experience to:
1. design the post-A1 (24-month) structure for a Germany-based company’s executive who is a Spanish tax resident under the Beckham regime, and
2. optimize the exercise/sale of unexercised stock options in the German company.

Scope
• Assess alternatives after the A1 secondment ends (Feb-2026): Spanish employment (entity or EOR), services/contracting (individual or holding company), staying on German payroll with possible Art. 16 Reg. 883/2004 extension, and related permanent establishment and governance issues.
• Confirm Spanish treatment of stock options (employment income at exercise, class-based FMV) and foreign-source capital-gains treatment on sale of German shares under Beckham.
• Advise on class-based valuation (waterfall) to establish FMV for common; compare one-shot exercise vs multi-year tranches, exercise-sale timing separation, and potential holding-company (UG) route (German 95% participation exemption on gains, dividend WHT, treaty).
• Provide a clear recommendation, scenario modeling, checklist of clauses (valuation, exercise windows, timing, loan/security if needed), and an execution timeline.

Deliverables
• Written memo (DE/ES) covering legal/tax/SS analysis and numerical scenarios, including recommendation based on legal risk and financial impact optimisation.
• List of filings/approvals and a timeline to implement before Feb-2026.

Product-led growth expert to implement self-service funnel in B2B/SaaS app

Context

We're a European All-in-one HR platform for SMBs. We're looking for ways to optimise our acquisition efforts and this project is our most important bet in this direction.

Idea

We want to implement a self-service funnel in our product where a prospect can test our product, buy, and onboard themselves without talking to a person from our team. This is currently not possible, mainly due to technical limitations in the product.

We pursue two goals with these project:

1- Have a very efficient acquisition funnel that help us lower our overall cost of acquisition. Ideally fully self-service / no touch.

2-Improve unit economics for our low/medium touch funnel through better qualification of leads based on free trial usage.

What we are looking for

We are looking for someone with a combination of growth and product management skills. Ideally you can analyse our current free trial to customer flow, make proposals for improvements, and write user stories / Jira tickets for our tech team to work on. Deep analytical knowledge is required to build product analytics, together with our product team, so we can identify high-intent free trial users and potential for conversion rate optimisation.

Project

This is a medium to long term project, we expect to work together with you for several months on this project.
