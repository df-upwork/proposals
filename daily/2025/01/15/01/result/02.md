1) Stripe Connect is used for marketplaces: intermediary platforms that collect payments from some individuals (buyers) on behalf of other individuals (sellers) and then distribute those payments to the sellers, keeping the fees.
2) The developers of Shopify and BigCommerce do not focus on giving their customers the ability to run marketplaces. 
3) On the other hand, Shopify and BigCommerce are exclusively SaaS-based and withhold their source code, so they are not flexible enough to build the missing marketplace-like features.
4) The developers of Shopify and BigCommerce do not offer a ready-made integration with Stripe Connect.
4.1) Shopify can be integrated with Stripe Connect via a «Payment extension»: https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/payments
4.2) BigCommerce can be integrated with Stripe Connect via the «Payments API»: https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/store-operations/payments
5) Shopify promotes its own payment system — Shopify Payments.
Since the integration with Stripe Connect will run outside Shopify Payments, Shopify will impose an additional transaction fee (it could be +2%, +1%, or +0.5% – depending on the plan).
6)
6.1) BigCommerce is an outsider compared to Shopify: it entered the market much later than Shopify and was built to mimic Shopify.
6.2) Therefore, they are forced to maintain lower margins (in particular, they still avoid imposing a transaction fee).
6.3) But BigCommerce has its own trap: if your turnover goes beyond $400K a year, you will be pushed onto their top-tier «Enterprise» plan with unpublished rates: basically, their sales team will extort from you as much as they can get.
With your (presumably low-margin) intermediary business model, this becomes especially precarious: your partner-sellers will generate turnover for you, and you will have to pay for the turnover to BigCommerce.
