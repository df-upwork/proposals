1) The Flow of Funds diagram is a key document required by regulators.
It must describe every step of each planned financial transaction type, e.g.:
- Transfer of funds from person to person (P2P).
- Bill payments on behalf of the client.
- Transactions using prepaid cards (stored value).
Each diagram must visually represent the complete transaction lifecycle, from the moment funds are received from the sender to when they are delivered to the recipient.
It is necessary to indicate on which accounts (proprietary, transit, partner) and at what point in time the funds are located.
Incomplete or ambiguous diagrams may raise suspicion among regulators regarding a lack of transparency, which could result in prolonged correspondence and requests for clarification.
This document is one of the first that a regulator reviews to understand the core of the business.
2) Match the planned operations with the official FinCEN classification.
3) Determine in which states the company will operate, as a license is required in each state where money transmission services are provided.
4) For a small company like yours (2-9 employees), attempting simultaneous licensing in multiple states is extremely risky.
5) Develop a strategic plan for sequential market entry into various states.
6) Licensing requirements, especially financial requirements such as minimum net worth and surety bond amounts, vary significantly from state to state.
For example, in the state of Washington, the minimum net worth is $10,000, while in New Mexico, $500,000 is required for an internet business.
7) The choice of the first state for licensing affects not only the initial costs, but also the company's reputation with other regulators.
Successfully obtaining the first license in a state with moderate requirements establishes a positive precedent, confirming the business model's viability and the adequacy of the compliance programs.
This can simplify subsequent applications because regulators in other states will see that the company has already passed a review.
8) The company's legal structure and financial condition must comply with regulatory standards.
9) The company must be in good standing in its state of incorporation.
This is confirmed by the corresponding certificate (Certificate of Good Standing), which must be provided to the regulators.
10) If the company plans to operate in states other than its state of incorporation, it must register as a foreign company in each target state.
11) Financial statements are one of the most critical components of the application.
Most states require the submission of audited financial statements for the last fiscal year, as well as for the 2 preceding years if the company has been in existence longer.
These statements must be prepared by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) in accordance with GAAP.
12) Provide interim (quarterly) financial statements (in addition to the annual financial statements).
These statements may be unaudited; however, they must be dated no later than 90 days before submitting the license application.
This allows the regulator to see the company's current financial condition.
13) For companies that have just started operations and do not have a financial history, the requirements are adapted.
In this case, it is necessary to provide an initial statement of condition and documentation supporting the method and source of capitalization.
For startups lacking a transaction history that can be analyzed for money laundering risks, verifying the source of initial investments is the primary method by which the regulator can assess AML risk at the earliest stage.
It is necessary to prepare a comprehensive explanation, accompanied by supporting documents (such as bank statements, loan agreements, and investment agreements), that demonstrates the lawful and transparent origin of the funds.
Any ambiguity at this stage will attract increased scrutiny and may result in denial.
14) Obtain a surety bond.
This is a form of financial guarantee that protects consumers and the state from potential losses if the company cannot fulfill its obligations.
Almost all states require such a bond.
In most cases, the bond is submitted electronically through NMLS.
15) In addition to financial documents, regulators require the submission of a package of documents describing the company's operational activities, management structure, and key personnel:
15.1) Business Plan
15.2) Organizational Chart
15.3) Management Chart
15.4) NMLS requires that an individual MU2 form be completed for each Control Person.
The definition of a Control Person may vary from state to state, but typically includes all direct and indirect owners with a share of 25% or more, as well as all key executives (e.g., CEO, CFO, CCO).
16) Implement and document an anti-money laundering program (AML/BSA program) that complies with BSA requirements:
16.1) Officially appoint a BSA Compliance Officer.
16.2) Develop an AML/BSA policy.
16.3) Develop a customer identification program (CIP).
17) Regulators require the AML program to undergo regular independent testing to assess its adequacy and effectiveness.
18) Develop a cybersecurity program based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).
19) It is necessary to create a Written Information Security Plan (WISP).
20) Implement technical controls:
20.1) Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
20.2) Encryption
20.3) Antivirus software
20.4) Patch management: a procedure for the timely installation of security updates for operating systems and software.
20.5) Centralized access control: the use of systems that allow for centrally managing employee access rights to various resources.
21) Develop a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan (BCP/DR):
21.1) Business Impact Analysis (BIA).
Its purpose is to identify the company's critical business processes and IT systems and to assess the potential damage (financial, reputational, regulatory) from their downtime over various periods.
21.2) Business Continuity Plan (BCP).
BCP is a strategic document that describes how the company will maintain key business functions during and after an emergency.
It must address not only technical failures but also other events such as natural disasters, power outages, or pandemics.
The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed regulators' expectations for a BCP.
A special guidance has been issued, emphasizing the importance of preparedness for mass remote work.
A modern BCP must mandatorily contain a separate, detailed section on «Pandemic Response and Remote Work Organization».
21.3) Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP).
DRP is the technical part of the BCP, focused on the recovery of the IT infrastructure and data.
The plan must contain step-by-step instructions for IT personnel.
21.4) Vendor Management Policy.
Modern FinTech companies are heavily dependent on third-party service providers: cloud providers (AWS, Azure), API providers, payment gateways, data verification systems, etc.
Each such provider is a potential point of failure or a source of risk.
Regulators expect the company to manage these risks as diligently as its own.
