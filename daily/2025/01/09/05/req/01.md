Вот так ChatGPT описал главную страницу сайта клиента:
<описание>
На скриншотах видно, что сайт (Lifee+ или LifeePlus) позиционирует себя как платформу, где люди могут оформлять платную подписку и получать “онлайн-шопинг инструменты” и различные скидки у множества брендов. Ниже разберём детальнее:

### Что продаёт сайт?
1. **Подписки на скидки и программы лояльности.** Судя по структуре, сайт не торгует товарами напрямую, а предлагает подписку (Membership) за ежемесячную плату, открывающую доступ к скидкам и “эксклюзивным предложениям” у разных крупных брендов (Adidas, Bose, Vans, LG, GoPro, Panasonic и т.д.).
2. **Собственный мерч.** На сайте упоминаются скидки на мерч под брендом Lifee+.
3. **Онлайн-сервис для участия в локальных мероприятиях.** Отдельно говорится о “Local Meetups & Events”, то есть подписка может включать приглашения на какие-то офлайн-события.

Таким образом, основная идея: пользователь покупает подписку → получает доступ к закрытым скидкам, спецпредложениям и розыгрышам.

### Какова бизнес-модель?
1. **Модель подписки (subscription).** Пользователь ежемесячно или ежегодно платит за членство, получая определённый пакет преимуществ (уровни «менее 1 доллара в день», «менее 2 долларов в день» и т.д.).  
2. **Партнёрские программы/реферальные вознаграждения.** Сайт, вероятно, зарабатывает ещё и на комиссионных от партнёрских ссылок. Когда пользователь совершает покупку у одного из брендов-партнёров (с применением скидочного кода или через промо-линк), владелец платформы может получать процент (это типичная модель аффилиат-маркетинга).
3. **Продажа собственного мерча.** Это может быть небольшим дополнительным источником дохода.

### Похож ли сайт на мошеннический?
На первый взгляд, **визуально** сайт оформлен достаточно профессионально:  
- Указан юридический владелец: «Media Group Australia Pty Ltd»,  
- Присутствует ABN (австралийский бизнес-номер),  
- Есть ссылки на Условия использования, Политику возвратов и конфиденциальности,  
- Предложение “7-дневного бесплатного пробного периода” (часто встречается у подписочных сервисов).

Все эти детали обычно говорят в пользу того, что сайт действует легально. Но абсолютную гарантию дать нельзя:  
- Следует проверить, действительно ли при регистрации (или покупке) вы получаете реальные скидки и партнерские предложения.  
- Узнать, как проходят списания после бесплатного периода, легко ли отменить подписку.  
- Посмотреть независимые отзывы или упоминания о данном сервисе в интернете (например, в соцсетях или на Trustpilot).

Если отзывы о “Lifee+” в основном положительные и пользователи реально пользуются скидками, а списания прозрачны, то сайт, скорее всего, не является мошенническим. Но если возникают постоянные жалобы на скрытые платежи, трудности с отменой или невыполненные обещания по скидкам — это повод насторожиться.

**Коротко резюмируя**: судя по скриншоту, проект представляет собой подписочную платформу для скидок и дополнительных бонусов от известных брендов. Сама идея (модель аффилиат + подписка) нередко встречается и может быть вполне рабочей. Чтобы исключить риск мошенничества, как всегда, лучше изучить отзывы и аккуратно проверить условия подключения/отмены подписки.

VIP discounts provided at any level of membership are subject to the terms and conditions set out either by LIFEE+ or as provided by the relevant partner. VIP discounts may be updated at any time, and the brand offerings shown on our website may not be accurate or available at the time you access our website.

LIFEE+ is not responsible if a discount offered by a partner is changed, removed, or for any exclusions that may apply. LIFEE+ is not liable for any loss related to any use of the VIP discounts.

7-day free trial

We also provide a ‘7-day free trial’ option that is available at limited times and complements our three-tier VIP Membership packages. This trial period grants users access to our database of promotional offers.

*Note: Only 1 trial per user is allowed. We allow the right to decline multiple attempts to re-join our membership if the same location or user details are used multiple times.

The free trial provides you with an opportunity to see how membership works before paying for a membership tier.

You will be automatically billed after your free trial period ends using your billing details entered during signup and placed on the selected billing plan you have chosen. To cancel, you will need to email us directly at hello@lifeeplus.com at least 24 hours before your trial period expires.

Entries into promotional draws

Entries accrue for every month that VIP members hold membership. The number of entries that accrue will depend on the membership tier that you hold during that month.

Members are able to accumulate entries on a monthly basis for the duration of their membership. The accumulated entries are subject to our sole discretion and are awarded based on your level of membership, how many draws in a month and how long you hold your membership.

VIP membership entries into promotional draws are generated before the relevant promotion period commences. Please check the LIFEE+ member portal via www.lifestylegoplus.com/login to view your entries. If your entries are not showing inside your portal, contact us at hello@lifeeplus.com

You must read these terms in conjunction with the relevant promotion’s terms and conditions. Entries into promotional draws are subject to these membership terms and conditions as well as those for a particular promotion.

Upgrade or downgrade of VIP membership

If you want to upgrade or downgrade your VIP membership, you can do so at any time through your LIFEE+ portal. Any changes to your VIP membership will come into effect at the start of the next billing cycle. We do not offer refunds or discounts if your membership is upgraded or downgraded during a billing cycle.

2. TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP AND FREE TRIALS

You may terminate your membership subscription at any time, at least 7 days prior from the end of your monthly billing renewal period. Free-Trial periods can be cancelled if you give us at least 24 hours’ notice with your intention to cancel in writing by emailing our team at hello@lifeeplus.com

If you terminate your membership, your membership benefits will continue until the end of your current membership term. Once the current membership term has expired, you will no longer be billed and all benefits will cease.

Except in accordance with Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Australian Consumer Law) or if we cancel your subscription without cause, you will not be entitled to a prorated refund of any portion of the Membership fees paid for the then current subscription term.

Once the cancellation process is complete, you will be sent a confirmation email. No refund will be offered if you cancel your membership mid-billing cycle.

Cancellation of your membership will not remove you from our marketing database. To remove yourself from our marketing database you must click the unsubscribe link in the promotional email or SMS message (as relevant) and follow the prompts.

If you hold a VIP membership and, for any reason, a direct debit for payment of your VIP membership fails, we will attempt to debit your payment method on four further occasions every five days over a 15-day period after the initial payment failure. If, after four attempts, we are unable to debit your VIP membership payment, your VIP membership and all membership benefits will be terminated.

A VIP membership can be resubscribed to at any time. You will retain all previous benefits you held under your VIP membership provided that you resubscribe within 30 days of cancelling your VIP membership or your VIP membership being cancelled by us because your direct debit was declined. You previous benefits held by you will not carry over if you do not resubscribe within 30 days.

Я так понял, что бизнес клиента не нравится австралийским банкам, и поэтому банки не дают клиенту «internet Merchant Facility».
Интересно, какие австралийские платёжные сервисы позволят клиенту принимать платежи в его сомнительном бизнесе?
