1) In your case, it is correct to use the "cost of services plus" method (26 CFR §1.482-9(e), https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.482-9#e).
It is likely that many will mistakenly recommend the "services cost" method (26 CFR §1.482-9(b), https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.482-9#b), but this method is not applicable here, because it applies to "low value-adding" services, whereas the present services include "executive oversight, business setup, financial structuring, and strategy development".
3) To apply CUP or TNMM, it is necessary to find an example of similar services provided by independent suppliers under comparable conditions.
It is unclear where such an example could be found in this case, so I do not recommend CUP and TNMM.
4) For the "cost of services plus" method it is necessary to carefully select and justify the "gross services profit markup" on the cost of services provided by your directors.
The essence of the "arm's length" principle is to treat the transaction as if the UK directors were providing services not to the US subsidiary but to a third-party US company.
Because the directors would not work for a third-party company at cost, there must be a "gross services profit markup" in the accounts.
The Big 4 (Ernst & Young, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) use a gross profit markup of around 20-40%.
In your case (an intra-group advisory), I recommend 15%.
5) The recommended "Reduced scope transfer pricing analysis" is as follows:
5.1.1) Parties to the transaction.
5.1.2) The nature of the services provided:
- Executive oversight
- Business setup
- Financial structuring
- Strategy development
5.1.3) Amount and date of the invoice.
5.1.4) Strategic objective: ensure that the management fee meets the "arm's length" principle.
5.2) Regulatory framework:
- IRS §482
- Treasury Regulations, 26 CFR §1.482-1 and §1.482-9
- OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
5.3) The method chosen ("сost of services plus").
5.4) Functional analysis:
5.4.1) Functions of the service provider (Printspace Studios Ltd).
5.4.2) Functions of the service recipient (theprintspace inc).
5.4.3) Conclusion of the functional analysis.
5.5) Calculation of the cost base (based on `Management fee recharge.xlsx`).
5.6) Supporting documents.
5.7) Justification of the "gross services profit markup".
6) "What would be the estimated cost and timeline for a reduced scope transfer pricing analysis?"
It will take approximately 15-20 working hours.
7) "Would this analysis provide sufficient documentation to support the management fee if reviewed by the IRS?"
Yes.
8) "Are there any best practices or additional steps we should consider?"
8.1) It is necessary to ensure that the "Transfer Pricing Analysis" data are consistent with the accounting data and with Form 1120.
8.2) It is necessary to complete Form 5472 correctly by selecting the correct transaction code and indicating the amount including the "gross services profit markup".
8.3) Neither the US nor the UK requires a transfer pricing analysis to be filed with the tax return.
Instead, it is provided to the tax authorities upon request.
