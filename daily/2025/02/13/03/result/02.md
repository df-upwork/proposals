1) To get access to the API, you need to fill out this form: https://www.autotrader.co.uk/partners/retailer/auto-trader-connect#get-started
It is explicitly stated in the API documentation: https://developers.autotrader.co.uk/api#contact-us
2) Other freelancers will suggest parsing the Autotrader website instead of using the API.
This is prohibited by Autotrader's rules.
Autotrader will repeatedly ban a program that works in this way, and you will spend a lot of time and money trying to bypass these bans.
