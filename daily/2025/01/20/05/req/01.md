### 1.1. Title
Job to Close Open Workbooks
### 1.2. Description
I have an Excel Macro Workbook that is used by 10-15 staff at a business. They regularly leave the Workbook open on their desktop when they leave work for the day. This can be a problem when we want to release an update to that workbook.
I would like a job I can run on the network that would scan the open files and if one of our Excel Macro Workbooks is found to be open that workbook is closed gracefully, so that we are able to then replace that workbook with a new version.
If required the user running this job would have Admin privileges on the network.
Key Note: The Excel Macro Workbook is essentially an interface for the users and no information or details in the workbook need to be saved. Although if it is possible as part of the job the Excel Macro Workbook can be saved before it is closed.
