1) There is a stronger alternative solution to your problem: move all macros, functions, forms, and logic out of the main workbook and place them in a special add-in file (`.xlam`) stored on the network.
1.1) Instead of a heavy workbook with macros, users get:
1.1.1) Either a lightweight workbook (containing only the basic settings/formulas) that automatically loads the add-in on startup.
1.1.2) Or they get no file at all and simply add the add-in to their Excel settings, and the macros/buttons will appear in the «Add-ins» tab or the Excel «Ribbon».
1.2) Updating the add-in (replacing the `.xlam` file) is handled in a centralized way: you simply place the updated file in the network folder.
1.3) My solution has the main advantage: the main file is never locked.
1.4) Optionally, I can create a real-time update feature for the add-in, so that your employees do not even have to restart Excel (to use your new macros).
This can be done by programming the `.xlam` code to periodically check for the `.xlam` version on the server and, if it has changed, automatically reload the add-in without completely restarting Excel for the users.
2) I can still solve your problem in your way.
For example, this can be done via PowerShell.
Having PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) enabled and having the rights to a remote session, it can be done by running a script on a specific remote computer:
```
$computers = @("UserPC1","UserPC2","UserPC3")
foreach($c in $computers) {
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $c -FilePath "C:\Scripts\CloseExcelWorkbook.ps1" `
        -ArgumentList "MyExcelMacroWorkbook.xlsm", $false
}
```
