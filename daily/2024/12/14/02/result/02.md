In a fixed-budget project:  
1) The client achieves financial certainty.  
2) The client shifts the risk onto the contractor.  
3) The client almost always receives a low-quality result.  
This occurs because, in most cases, the client does not have the same level of expertise in the project's subject area as the contractor does, since that subject area is part of the contractor's professional domain, not the client's, which is a classic case of information asymmetry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry).  
For the contractor, a fixed-budget project is a constrained optimization problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_optimization), where quality is a controllable variable.  
To achieve the optimal solution to such a problem (minimizing their own costs), the contractor must deliver a result of the lowest possible quality that still formally meets the written contract.  
Because the contractor understands the subject matter better than the client, the contractor will almost always structure the contract to their own advantage.  
The client, not possessing the contractor's level of expertise in the field, is unable to anticipate all the quality criteria in the contract before the project starts.  
4) It is difficult for the client to make changes to the project without renegotiating terms.
