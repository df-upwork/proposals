The most probable reasons (in my experience) why a screen of a Python/Flask application shows outdated data from an SQLAlchemy database:
1) The most popular reason: maybe, objects are requested from the DB and stored somewhere (for example, in a global scope of the the application's memory or in a cache), and then upon subsequent access, the application reads the already existing objects instead of requesting them again from the DB.
2) The second most popular reason — it is the incorrect use of the same session between different HTTP requests.
In most cases, it is best to create a separate session for processing each HTTP request to the Flask application.  
After the work is completed (for example, when it is time to return a response to the client), this session is explicitly committed (commit) or rolled back (rollback), depending on whether the write operations to the database were successful, and then closed and «cleared».
3) From the last sentence of the previous paragraph follows another reason: the changes in the session may be not being committed (no `commit()` or `flush()` is called at the right time).   
4) The reason in using a multithreaded or multiprocess environment: a wrong configuration of `scoped_session`, where several requests are processed in parallel (for example, in gunicorn/uwsgi), the SQLAlchemy session can be incorrectly «shared» between different threads or processes.
