Fix Laravel CRM Login Issue (Cloudflare + WHM/cPanel Server)
### 1.2. Description
We are launching a new Laravel-based CRM but are currently unable to log in due to a session bug. We believe the Authorization header is being stripped from requests, preventing authentication.

Our Setup:
✅ Laravel-based CRM
✅ WHM/cPanel server
✅ Cloudflare for DNS
✅ Using Apache (or whatever default WHM/cPanel is running)
What We Need:
🔹 Identify why the Authorization header is missing/stripped
🔹 Configure Cloudflare, Apache, or server settings to resolve the issue
🔹 Ensure Laravel sessions and login work correctly
🔹 Provide a quick and effective fix
Who We're Looking For:
✔ Laravel, Cloudflare, and Apache expert
✔ Experience with WHM/cPanel hosting
✔ Immediate availability to troubleshoot and resolve the issue
If you’re confident you can fix this quickly, apply now and let us know your experience with similar issues.
