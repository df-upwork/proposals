# 1. Legal Framework
Legal relations between the Republic of Turkey and the United Kingdom in the field of social security are governed by the «**Convention between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Turkey on social insurance**» (hereinafter the `Convention`).  
The `Convention` was signed on 9 September 1959 and entered into force on 1 June 1961.  
In the United Kingdom, it was given effect by «**The National Insurance and Industrial Injuries (Turkey) Order, 1961**» (**S.I. 1961/584**): https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1961/584
## 2.1. Terminology
### 2.1.1.
The term «**A1 form**» is **incorrect** in this context.  
The «A1 form» is used exclusively to confirm social security coverage for workers moving within the **European Economic Area** and **Switzerland**.
### 2.1.2.
For countries with which the United Kingdom has bilateral social security agreements (also called «reciprocal agreements»), such as Turkey, the correct name for the document in the United Kingdom is «**Certificate of Coverage**» or «**Certificate of Continuing Liability**».
### 2.1.3.
The Turkish side refers to this document using the special bilateral form «**TUR 1A**».
### 2.1.4.
The use of **correct terminology** and, consequently, the correct application forms is a **fundamental condition for the successful completion of the procedure**.
An attempt to apply the logic or forms associated with the A1 certificate will result in a rejection.
## 2.2. «Identification of the official Turkish authority»
### 2.2.1.
According to **Articles 1(4)** and **1(5)** of the `Convention`:
- «**Competent authority**» for Turkey means «**the Ministry of Labour**».
- «**Social insurance authority**» for Turkey means «**the Workers' Insurance Institution**».
### 2.2.2.
This distinction is intentional and reflects standard practice in administrative law.   
The «Competent authority» (the Ministry) performs policy-making and regulatory functions, bears overall responsibility for the implementation of the agreement, and acts as the state's representative at the international level.  
At the same time, the «social insurance authority» (the Institution) is the executive, operational body that directly handles administrative functions, such as collecting contributions, processing applications, assigning and paying benefits, as well as issuing supporting documents, such as Certificates of Coverage.  
Since your task is to file applications and obtain a specific document, the **point of contact** for the applicant is the «**social insurance authority**», and not the Ministry.
### 2.2.3.
Since the signing of the `Convention` in 1959, Turkey's social security system has undergone a significant **reform**.  
The «**Workers' Insurance Institution**» (**Sosyal Sigortalar Kurumu**, **SSK**), mentioned in the text of the `Convention`, was one of the three main social insurance funds.  
In **2006**, as part of the reform, these funds were merged into a single entity, the Social Security Institution (**Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu**, **SGK**).   
Thus, the SGK is the full **legal successor** to the «Workers' Insurance Institution» and currently performs the functions of the «social insurance authority» within the meaning of the `Convention`.  
This institution bears the operational responsibility for implementing the provisions of the `Convention`.
### 2.2.4.
To implement international agreements and to standardize administrative procedures, SGK issues internal regulatory acts, known as circulars («genelge»).  
These documents serve as detailed instructions for regional offices and other interested parties employers, insured persons) on the application of various regulations.  
The key document that directly governs the procedures under the agreement with the United Kingdom is **SGK Circular No. 2020/25** (hereinafter the `Circular`) officially titled «**Türkiye Cumhuriyeti – Birleşik Krallık Sosyal Güvenlik Sözleşmesi**»: https://www.alomaliye.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sgk-genelgesi-2020-25.pdf
### 2.2.5.
According to **Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1** of the `Circular`, the initial application for the TUR 1A form is **submitted locally** to the territorial division of the SGK **where the Turkish employer is registered**:   
«Başvuruya istinaden TUR 1A formüleri, sigortalının işyerinin kayıtlı olduğu sosyal
güvenlik il müdürlüğü (SGİM) veya sosyal güvenlik merkezi (SGM) tarafından üç nüsha
halinde düzenlenerek iki nüshası Birleşik Krallıktaki yetkili kuruma verilmek üzere sigortalı
ya da işverene verilecek, bir nüshası dosyasında saklanacaktır.»  
Translation:  
«Based on the application, the Provincial Directorate of Social Security (SGİM) or the Social Security Centre (SGM) **where the insured person's employer is registered** issues the TUR 1A form in triplicate.  
2 copies are given to the insured person or the employer for submission to the competent institution in the United Kingdom, and 1 copy is retained for records.»
# 3. «A comprehensive list of all required documents and information»
## 3.1. Prerequisites and supporting documents
### 3.1.1. Employee's Citizenship
#### 3.1.1.1. Requirement
The employee must be a **citizen** of **Turkey** or the **United Kingdom**.  
**Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1** of the `Circular` states:  
«Akit taraflardan birinde çalışan bir sigortalının geçici görevlendirme kapsamında diğer akit taraf ülkesine gönderilebilmesi için Türkiye Cumhuriyeti veya Birleşik Krallık vatandaşı olması zorunludur.»  
«For an insured person working in one of the contracting parties to be sent to the country of the other contracting party under a temporary assignment, they must be a citizen of the Republic of Turkey or the United Kingdom.»
### 3.1.1.2. Required document
An identity card (Kimlik) or passport confirming the employee's citizenship of Turkey or the United Kingdom is required
## 3.2. Documents and information for the application for a Certificate of Coverage
### 3.2.1. Requirement
**Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1** of the `Circular` states:  
«Geçici görevlendirme talebi yapılırken sigortalı ya da işveren tarafından doldurulacak olan ve EK-1'de yer alan "Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi" ve ekinde görev yazısı ile birlikte Birleşik Krallıktaki işveren ile yapılmış olan iş sözleşmesinin, Birleşik Krallıkta çalışacağı işyeri adı ve adres bilgilerinin Kuruma ibraz edilmesi gerekmektedir.»  
«When requesting a temporary assignment, it is necessary to submit to the Institution [SGK] the «Request Application for a Temporary Assignment Abroad» (Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi), which is contained in Annex-1 (EK-1) and must be completed by the insured person or the employer, together with the accompanying letter of assignment (görev yazısı), as well as the employment contract concluded with the host entity in the United Kingdom, and information on the name and address of the host entity where the employee will be working in the United Kingdom.»
### 3.2.2. List of documents
Based on point 3.2.1, the following are required:
#### 3.2.2.1. Application for a Temporary Assignment Abroad (Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi)
This is a standard application form, provided in **Annex 1 (EK-1)** to the `Circular`.  
It must be completed and signed by the employer (or by an agent under a power of attorney).
It contains details on the employer, the employee, and the assignment.
#### 3.2.2.2. Letter of assignment (Görev yazısı)
This is an official letter from the Turkish employer confirming the assignment.  
It must include the purpose and the intended duration of the assignment.
#### 3.2.2.3. Document describing the terms of work in the United Kingdom 
This section addresses the interpretation of the requirement «Birleşik Krallıktaki işveren ile yapılmış olan iş sözleşmesi».  
A literal interpretation of the `Circular` requires the submission of «the employment contract concluded with the host entity in the United Kingdom».    
This requirement **contradicts the fundamental principle** of **Article 4(2)** of the `Convention`, according to which **the employee must remain in the service of the sending (Turkish) employer to maintain Turkish social security coverage**.    
Concluding a direct employment contract with a British company generally means becoming subject to the social security legislation of the United Kingdom and incurring the obligation to pay British National Insurance contributions (NIC), which defeats the purpose of obtaining the TUR 1A certificate.    
Consequently, this requirement must be interpreted functionally: as the need for documentary confirmation of the assignment conditions and the interaction with the host party, but not as a replacement for the main Turkish employment contract.  
In practice, such documents include:
- **An Assignment Agreement or a Secondment Agreement**: confirming the continuation of the Turkish employment relationship and defines the terms of the temporary work in the United Kingdom.
- **A Service Agreement between the Turkish employer and the United Kingdom company**: confirming the purpose and scope of the assignment if the employee is sent to fulfil this agreement.
  
It is critically important that the document provided cannot be interpreted by the SGK as a local United Kingdom employment contract.
#### 3.2.2.4. Information on the host entity in the United Kingdom
- Name (İşyeri adı).  
- Address (Adres bilgileri).
## 3.3. Documents confirming the agent's authority
Since you intend to submit applications on behalf of Turkish employers, you must be officially authorised to represent them before the SGK.  
This requirement stems from general norms of Turkish administrative law and the standard practice for interaction with government bodies.
### 3.3.1. Power of Attorney (Vekaletname)
This is an official document authorising you to file applications for a Certificate of Coverage and to liaise with the SGK on behalf of a Turkish employer.  
- It must be notarised by a Turkish notary.  
- It must explicitly include the authority to liaise with the SGK (SGK nezdinde işlem yapma yetkisi), particularly concerning international social security agreements.
# 4. «Clarification on the submission process—whether it is physical, email-based, or through an online portal accessible to foreign entities»
## 4.1. Physical submission
**Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1** of the `Circular` states:  
«EK-1'de yer alan "Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi" [...] Kuruma ibraz edilmesi gerekmektedir.»  
Translation:  
«Request Application for a Temporary Assignment Abroad» (Annex-1) [...] must be submitted (ibraz edilmesi) to the Institution.  
The term «ibraz edilmesi» (submission) and the requirement to submit a «Dilekçe» (Petition) imply a physical process.  
This is confirmed by the same **Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1** of the `Circular`, which states that the TUR 1A form is issued to the applicant in the form of **physical copies**:  
«[...] üç nüsha halinde düzenlenerek iki nüshası [...] sigortalı ya da işverene verilecek...»  
«[...] is issued in three copies, and two copies are given [...] to the insured person or the employer...»
Documents are submitted to the relevant SGİM/SGM in person or by post (registered post is recommended).
## 4.2. Online portal
The `Circular` does not mention an online portal for submitting applications for the TUR 1A form.
The procedure is **not integrated into public e-government portals** (e.g., e-Devlet).
## 4.3. Email
Submission via email is possible only via the Registered Electronic Mail (**KEP** — **Kayıtlı Elektronik Posta**) system, which **is legally binding**.
# 5. «Process Guide»
# 5.1. Collection of documents
Described in point 3 above.
# 5.2. Submission of the application to the competent SGK authority
Described in point 2 above.
# 5.3. Processing and issuance of Form TUR 1A
Await processing by the SGİM/SGM and obtain the issued TUR 1A form.  
The applicant (the employer or the authorized agent) receives 2 copies of the TUR 1A form for subsequent use in the United Kingdom (for submission to HMRC).
# 6. Challenges
## 6.1. Personal Scope Limitation
In Turkey, the Agreement applies only to employees (insured under Article 4/1(a) of Law No. 5510), **excluding the self-employed and civil servants**.  
This is stated in **Part 1, point 2** of the `Circular`:  
«Sözleşmenin kişisel kapsamında Türkiye bakımından yalnızca Kanunun 4 üncü maddesinin birinci fıkrasının (a) bendinde sayılan sigortalılar yer almakta olup...»  
«The personal scope of the Agreement on the part of Turkey includes only insured persons listed in point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 4 of the Law...»
## 6.2. Time Limitation
The **initial** assignment period is limited to **3 years**.  
An **extension** is possible for a maximum of **additional 3 years** (a total of 6 years).  
This is stated in **Part 2, Section 1, points 1.1.1 and 1.1.2** of the `Circular`:  
«1.1.1) Ancak, ilk görevlendirmede görev süresi 3 yılı geçemez.  
(1.1.2) Görev süresinin uzatılması da [...] en fazla 3 yıllık süre için talep edilecektir.»  
«(1.1.1) However, the period of the initial assignment cannot exceed 3 years.  
(1.1.2) An extension of the period of assignment will also be requested [...] for a maximum period of 3 years.»
## 6.3. Complexity of the extension procedure
The extension process is significantly more complex and lengthy than the initial application.  
It requires coordination at the central (national) level as well as international coordination.  
The local division of the SGK transfers the request to the General Directorate (EHGM), which then liaises with the United Kingdom authorities.  
This is stated in **Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.2** of the `Circular`:  
«İşveren tarafından geçici görev süresinin uzatılması için SGİM/SGM'ye verilen talepler Emeklilik Hizmetleri Genel Müdürlüğüne (EHGM) iletilecektir.  
Görev süresinin uzatılması hakkında Birleşik Krallık yetkili kurumu yapılacak yazışmalar EHGM tarafından gerçekleştirilecektir.»  
«Requests submitted by the employer to the SGİM/SGM for the extension of the temporary assignment period will be forwarded to the General Directorate of Pension Services (EHGM).  
Correspondence with the competent institution of the United Kingdom regarding the extension of the assignment period will be carried out by the EHGM.»
## 6.4. Restriction on the Place of Submission
The requirement for local submission at the employer's registered office (see point 2.2.5) may create logistical challenges for centralised management»).
