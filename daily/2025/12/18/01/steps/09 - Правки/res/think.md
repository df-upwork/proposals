# 1.

Submitting a flawed DR-26S application to `DOR` triggers a high risk of an audit exposing violations and penalties.
Consequently, careful consideration of the pitfalls below is essential.

# 2.

`DOR` enforces strict `UE†` barriers: «Sales and use tax dealers must first refund the customer before seeking a refund from the state».
This requirement creates significant logistical challenges.
To claim a refund, identification of `Gꆜ` and documentation of refunds are necessary.
If `Gꆜ` cannot be located, `DOR` will deny the refund claim.
Consequently, these funds remain with the state and cannot be recovered by `L⌹`.

# 3.

Some `Mᚖ` (e.g. Airbnb) remit `SST𐏐` to `DOR` but omit county-specific `TDT𐏐`.
This partial collection creates a liability to the county.
A valid refund claim arises only if `L⌹` erroneously remitted `TDT𐏐` to `DOR` instead of the local tax collector.
I will establish the evidence by reconciling `Mᚖ` reports with filed tax returns.

# 4.

I will export transaction reports from `Mᚖ` and `Qᨀ` data for the last 36 months to perform a 3-way reconciliation: compare taxes withheld by `Mᚖ`, taxes recorded in `Qᨀ`, and taxes actually paid via DR-15.
This analysis will distinguish duplicate payments from rate errors.

# 5.

For double payments, I will prove `TDT𐏐` remittance by `Mᚖ` to eliminate the `Gꆜ` refund requirement.
For rate errors where `Mᚖ` collected the correct amount, the overpayment constitutes `L⌹` funds.
In this scenario, I will claim the refund directly without reimbursing `Gꆜ`.

# 6.

I will file form DR-26S via the `DOR` portal.
For self-administered `TDT𐏐`, I will initiate a `VDA` process to settle liabilities and mitigate penalties.
Precise legal drafting in cover letters will prevent ambiguities triggering a full-scale audit.
