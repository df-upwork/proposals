Most likely, your tech person has configured Node.js on your Raspberry Pi server to function as a web server, without Nginx.
During the certificate update, your server was automatically reconfigured to use Nginx.
The most likely reasons for such an automatic reconfiguration are:
1) Certbot might have been run with the `--nginx` option.  
2) Cloudflare in the «Full/Strict SSL» mode requires a valid certificate from your server.
Your server (through some automated tool) receives this request from Cloudflare and erroneously attempts to automatically configure this certificate in Nginx instead of Node.js. 
3) In some Linux distributions (for example, Ubuntu Server with the `nginx-full` + `certbot` packages), there are preconfigured configuration files in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` or `/etc/letsencrypt/`.
During the installation or update of these packages, the distribution’s scripts can automatically reconfigure Nginx as the web server, ignoring your Node.js web server.
