As for your PWA frontend, it won’t affect the integration process significantly. 
These services typically integrate directly with the Magento 2 backend (or its APIs), not your storefront’s frontend. 
That means your PWA is simply a presentation layer. 
Once the backend data—prices, competitor URLs, and updated product information—is synced and maintained by the service’s integration, your PWA will automatically reflect these changes as it fetches data from the Magento 2 backend.
