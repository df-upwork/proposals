DevOps, LB in OC spitting 502 when refreshing in a sveltekit SSR project

## 2.3. Description

```text
Running into a super annoying issue with Oracle Cloud’s load balancer and hoping someone here has seen it before.

Setup:

Frontend is SvelteKit, sitting behind Nginx.

Traffic goes through an Oracle Cloud public load balancer (HTTPS).

Health checks are green, normal client-side navigation works fine.

The problem:
If I refresh a page (so the app does a full server-side render instead of just SPA navigation), the load balancer often spits out a 502 Bad Gateway. If I hit the backend directly (bypass LB), everything works. It only happens through the LB, and only on refresh/deep links.

What I’ve tried:

Bumped up LB timeouts (idle + response) to 60–120s.

Made sure SSR fetches don’t loop back through the public LB domain.

----------------------------------------

this a quick project, we need a quick solution from someone with experience working in similar issue there will be no interview. quick screening through the questioner and we might ask some questions in the chat if we felt that we need it

1) In my experience, your issue is highly likely caused by the reasons described in points 2 and 3 below.
Both hypotheses explain the observed symptoms well, and they can be present simultaneously.
2) Exceeding HTTP header size limits on the OCI LB.
2.1) OCI Load Balancers have strict limits on the maximum size of response headers from the backend. When performing SSR, SvelteKit generates large headers, particularly the `Link` header for preload assets, as well as large `Set-Cookie` headers. If the header size exceeds the OCI LB limit, the load balancer returns a 502.
2.2) This hypothesis precisely explains the difference between SSR (large headers) and SPA navigation (small API response headers).
2.3) This hypothesis also explains why direct access works: Nginx and browsers have higher limits than the OCI LB.
2.4) OCI Load Balancers have a fixed limit on the maximum size of HTTP response headers (Response Headers) from the backend.
According to Oracle, this limit is 8KB: https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Oracle%20Cloud/2603461_1.html
Exceeding this limit results in a 502 error, even if the backend responded with 200 OK.
The OCI documentation describes the configuration of HTTP Header Rules in OCI LB Rule Sets, but it allows increasing the limit only for request headers (Request Headers, exceeding which causes a 400 error), and does not affect the response headers limit.
Therefore, to solve this problem, it is necessary to reduce the size of the headers generated by SvelteKit during SSR (e.g., by optimizing `Link` preload headers or `Set-Cookie`).
3) `Keep-Alive` timeouts mismatch.
3.1) A 502 error can occur due to a race condition when reusing persistent connections (`Keep-Alive`).
The OCI LB maintains a connection pool with the backend (Nginx).
If Nginx closes the connection (upon reaching its `keepalive_timeout`) before the LB-to-Backend Idle Timeout on the load balancer expires, the LB may attempt to send a new request over an already closed connection, which leads to a 502 error.
3.2) This is a classic cause of intermittent 502 errors, which directly corresponds to your description «often spits out a 502».
3.3) The problem occurs only through the LB, because with direct access this connection management mechanism is not involved.
3.4) It is critically important that the `Keep-Alive` timeout on the backend (Nginx `keepalive_timeout`) be greater than the LB-to-Backend Idle Timeout on the OCI LB.
According to the OCI documentation («Load Balancer Timeout Connection Settings»), the OCI LB closes connections to the backend that have been idle for more than 300 seconds (a fixed value for the LB-to-Backend Idle Timeout).
If the `keepalive_timeout` in Nginx is less than this value (e.g., the default value of 75s), this creates ideal conditions for the problem to occur.
The OCI documentation recommends setting the timeout on the backend to at least 310 seconds to prevent 502 errors.
Increasing the Listener Idle Timeout (which defines the idle time during the HTTP request/response phase, not between requests), which you have undertaken, does not affect this mechanism.
3.5) This hypothesis explains well why the problem occurs predominantly during SSR (page refresh).
SSR requests often occur after a period of user inactivity.
If the idle time exceeds the Nginx `keepalive_timeout` but is less than the LB-to-Backend Idle Timeout (300s), the described race condition occurs.
SPA navigation, in contrast, generates frequent requests that keep the connection active and prevent the idle timeouts from being reached.
