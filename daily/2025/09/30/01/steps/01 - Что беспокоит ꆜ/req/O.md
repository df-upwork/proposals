Corporate Restructuring Expert

`PD` ≔

We are seeking an experienced Corporate Restructuring Expert to assist with a small-scale project. 
The ideal candidate will have a strong background in corporate restructuring and be able to provide strategic insights and solutions.

Currently we have one Company in USA and another in Canada. 
There were other companies too who holds real estate in Canada and operations in the USA which are or in the process of dissolution. 
All Companies have filed Subchapter V Bankruptcy in 2023 which was concluded in 2024.

## What we need:
### 1. Ring-fence shareholder exposure 
Establish clear separation between personal ownership and corporate liabilities.
### 2. Segregate operations and assets
Keep high-risk trading activities (procurement, sales, logistics) separate from asset-holding entities (property, brand/IP).
### 3. Optimize cross-border structure
Ensure Canadian operations (procurement, storage, grading) and U.S. operations (sales, distribution) are insulated from one another’s legal and financial risks.
### 4. Position for future growth
Build a simplified, investor-ready structure that avoids entanglement with inactive or legacy entities.
### 5. Shelter from operational income for tax purposes
US and Canada entities generating profits should be parked somewhere in the world to save taxes or plan for reinvestment in such a way to minimize tax exposure.
### 6. Carve out Brokerage Business 
Currently, all the brokerage business is included in Canada operations without any clear distinction between brokerage and regular business. 
We need to separate both businesses to evaluate profitability of each business.

## Deliverables
- Provide strategic restructuring advice
- Analyze current corporate structure
- Develop restructuring plans
