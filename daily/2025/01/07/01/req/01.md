#### Title
Automotive Website - Product Upsell/Upgrades Implementation - Magento 2
#### Description
We have an automotive client and require product upgrades to be implemented following the designs.
The website is on Magento 2 - A staging/test website is available, however the successful applicant will need to create a development environment for the work to be completed before we push to staging for testing and to production once approved by the client.
The intention, following the design, is to allow for certain products on the website to be "upgraded", with the customer choosing an option on the PDP (product detail page).
When the customer chooses an upgrade option, instead of additional products being added to the cart, an entirely new product needs to be added to the cart to ensure the correct SKU is sent to the client's ERP system.
For example, I am on product page for the part 12345, however, I choose upgraded springs, the product that will go into the cart is 12345S instead, in replacement of the original part.
The "upgraded" products will be their own products entirely in the back-end of Magento as the pricing will be different from the basic/core SKU. However, they should not be available in search on the website or externally.
From a customer view, the pricing should be shown in addition to the core/basic SKU. For example, if the basic product is £500 and the upgraded part is £600, next to the upgrade it would show +£100.
With this being automotive data, upgrades can be different per products and so can the pricing.
We would require an area within Magento admin to be able to assign the upgrade product individually to its parent. In addition to this, there is an "i" icon to explain which each of the upgrades means. These fields will also need to be customisable per product as they will often be different and have different uses.
Finally - Stock will need to be considered as part of this. As they are their own products on page load a stock check would need to be performed against each of the SKUs available as part of the core product and the upsell. If the upgrade option is out of stock it would need to "grey out" to be made unavailable for purchase.
