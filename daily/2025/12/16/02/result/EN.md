1) Both structures considered by you are not the best for solving your task.
In points 3 and 4 I outline their main disadvantages.
In point 5 I outline a much higher quality structure in your case.

2) Key designations in my analysis:
Malta: `M᛭`
Cyprus: `C᛭`.
USA: `U᛭`
Cyprus Holding: `CHᨀ`
Malta Consolidated Group (Fiscal Unit): `MHᨀ`
Malta Trading Ltd: `MTᨀ`
The Income Tax Act of `M᛭`: `ITA`
Place of Effective Management: `POEM`
Your US LLC: `Uᨀ`
Your proposed structure «`CHᨀ` + `MTᨀ`»: `CH⧟MT`
Your proposed structure «`MHᨀ` + `MTᨀ`»: `MH⧟MT`

3) Disadvantages of `CH⧟MT`
Registration of `CHᨀ` as the «Principal Taxpayer» in `M᛭` combined with the management of the company by you (residing in `M᛭`) creates a strong presumption that the `POEM` is in `M᛭`.
Under the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), the residency tie-breaker requires a Mutual Agreement Procedure, creating a high risk that `CHᨀ` will be treated as a tax resident of `M᛭`.
This will lead to the loss of `C᛭` tax advantages and the taxation of `CHᨀ` in `M᛭` on a remittance basis, covering income arising in `M᛭` and foreign income remitted to `M᛭`.

4) Disadvantages of `MH⧟MT`
4.1) Using `MHᨀ` with the payment of 5% tax results in the majority of profits being allocated to the «Untaxed Account», as the tax paid is insufficient to fully populate the «Maltese Taxed Account».
According to Article 61 of `ITA`, the portion of dividends paid from the «Untaxed Account» to a resident individual is subject to a final withholding tax of 15%.
This increases your effective tax burden from 5% to approximately 17.9% (5% CIT + ~12.9% WHT), making `MH⧟MT` economically inefficient.
4.2) Since `MHᨀ` is a company resident in `M᛭`, dividends distributed by it are legally classified as domestic income under Article 4(1)(a) of `ITA`, regardless of the fiscal unit’s internal attribution rules.
For you, this means dividends are ineligible for the Remittance Basis, which applies only to foreign source income.
Such dividends trigger the 15% final tax liability mentioned above, regardless of whether they are remitted to `M᛭` or kept abroad.
4.3) You lose the method of protecting your assets from direct claims via a foreign holding.

5) A high-quality strategy for solving your task
5.1) Essence: `CH⧟MH⧟MT`
5.2) Implementation:
5.2.1) `CHᨀ` must own 100% of `MHᨀ` shares.
5.2.2) `MHᨀ` and `MTᨀ` form an internal fiscal unit, allowing the payment of consolidated tax at a rate of 5% immediately.
5.2.3) `MTᨀ` incorporates a new US C-Corporation (`U2ᨀ`) to purchase the business assets from `Uᨀ` at fair market value to cut off historical liabilities.
This Asset Deal triggers immediate capital gains tax in `U᛭` but ensures a clean compliance slate.
`U2ᨀ` pays 21% Federal CIT and distributes dividends to `MTᨀ` subject to 15% withholding tax (the 5% rate is unavailable due to the US-Italy treaty mismatch).
5.2.4) Profit, cleared of taxes (95%), is distributed from `MHᨀ` to `CHᨀ` without withholding taxes in `M᛭`.
5.2.5) You receive dividends from `CHᨀ` into a non-Maltese bank account.
These dividends remain tax-free in `M᛭` only if not remitted; any funds transferred to `M᛭` for living expenses are taxed at 15%.
5.3) Advantages
5.3.1) Simultaneous achievement of corporate liquidity via the payment of 5% tax in `M᛭` (after 21% US CIT) without delays and 0% personal tax on unremitted dividends.
5.3.2) Legal isolation of `CHᨀ` from `MH⧟MT` minimizes residency risk only if effective management is physically exercised in `C᛭` by local directors, preventing the creation of a `POEM` in `M᛭`.
5.3.3) Creation of a protected investment perimeter at the level of `CHᨀ`, which facilitates access to Swiss banking for capital accumulation.
5.3.4) Full legitimacy of using the 5% rate in `M᛭` combined with asset protection through a foreign jurisdiction.
