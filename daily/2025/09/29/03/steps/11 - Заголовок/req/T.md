1) «the new sales tax setup makes no sense»
The system's logic is specifically designed to ensure compliance with complex tax legislation.
California uses a modified origin sourcing model for intrastate sales.
State, county, and city taxes are origin-based, whereas district taxes are destination-based.
Automated Sales Tax (`AST`) in QuickBooks Online (`QBO`) automatically handles these complex rules and thousands of jurisdictions in the Bay Area.
Managing this manually is highly impractical and prone to errors.
2) «seems that sales tax rate needs to be added manually» 
That is incorrect.
The purpose of `AST` is specifically to eliminate the need for manual tracking and input of tax rates.
Intuit automatically updates the rates when the legislation changes.
3) «The customer section has a box checked for “sales tax” but there is nothing further than that»
Since the rate depends on the exact shipping address in a specific transaction, which can change, storing a static rate in the customer profile is incorrect.
Therefore, `AST` intentionally does not store the rate in the customer profile.
The profile only determines the tax status (Taxable/Exempt).
Intuit removed the ability to set a default tax code once AST is activated.
4) «I need to have clients sales tax rates setup and flowing to 3rd party tool»
4.1) The `AST` system calculates tax dynamically at the time of the transaction.
The standard `QBO` Accounting REST API (V3) does not allow a third-party application to retrieve the tax rate calculated by `AST` before a transaction is created and saved in `QBO`.
4.2) There are two main approaches to solving this integration problem.
I outline them in points 5 and 6 below.
The feasibility of either approach depends on the technical capabilities of the third-party tool and its ability to integrate with external APIs or to modify its synchronization logic with `QBO`.
5) Approach 1: Implementing a specialized tax service (e.g., Avalara, TaxCloud, TaxJar).
The third-party tool must integrate with the API of this service to retrieve the accurate tax rate in real time.
6) Approach 2: Integrating the third-party tool with the Intuit Sales Tax API (GraphQL).
This allows the tool to retrieve the `AST`-calculated rate in real time.
7) In both approaches, during the subsequent synchronization of a transaction with `QBO` via the Accounting REST API (V3), the Sales Tax Override mechanism must be used.
For a reliable override, this requires not only passing the total tax amount via the `TxnTaxDetail.TotalTax` field, but also providing a reference to a Custom Sales Tax Code (`USER_DEFINED` type) via the `TxnTaxDetail.TxnTaxCodeRef` field. 
Additionally, an up-to-date API version (`minorversion`) must be used.
8) Approach 1 has the following advantages compared to Approach 2:
8.1) Increased accuracy and compliance.
Specialized services use advanced address validation and geolocation methods (address-level accuracy) to account for all local and district taxes.
This ensures maximum calculation accuracy in complex jurisdictions (Bay Area).
8.2) Powerful Proprietary API.
The third-party tool can be integrated directly with the specialized service to retrieve rates in real-time, bypassing the limitations of the `QBO` Accounting REST API.
8.3) Compliance automation.
This includes automatic rate updates, accurate reporting for the CDTFA, and automated tax filing.
8.4) Stability and Scalability.
This approach provides a stable, scalable solution that is independent of the limitations or changes in the Intuit API.
