Appeals Paralegal Needed for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals

## 6.3.3. Description
`P3D` ≔ 
```text
Hello,

My Name is Farkhan Shah and I am writing to you because I need a Paralegal who can help with appeals in the Third Circuit of Appeals. A small breakdown of my case so you can decide whether or not you wish to take on this Appeals job.

    1. There were material facts in controversy especially since spoliation of evidence and perjury was committed by opposing side and the Judge still moved for Motion Summary Judgement which is not allowed in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under Rule 56, 60 (b), and 12(h)(3).

    2. The federal Judge had Venue but lacked subject matter jurisdiction and ruled on documents that were

            Rejected by the Clerk of The Court on July 23-24, 2021 and Counsel were asked to resubmit

            The July 26, 2021 submission was 3 days late where even the Third circuit did not have Jurisdiction

    3. The Judge made a secret ruling in her chambers where the public did not have access to Judicial scrutiny which the Supreme Court Ruled is a First amendment violation which also gives perception of Judicial Abuse.

    4. The Judge Ruled on documents from a Fashion corporation that was unauthorized to practice Law in New Jersey under Rule 1:21- Practice of Law governing the state of New Jersey.

    5. Due process was violated and the first, fourth, fifth, seventh eleventh and fourteenth amendment was violated.

I would like to appeal this case. Could you help me? I filed a 56 page motion to vacate summary Judgement with over 42 exhibits, however that will not be decided until after October 10, 2022. I need to file a brief as soon as possible. Please advise if you can help.

Sincerely,


Farkhan Shah
