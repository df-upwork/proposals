1) Residential Property / Depreciation / for Federal Tax:  
1.1) MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) parameters:  
- Recovery period: 27.5 years.  
- Method: straight-line.   
- Convention: mid-month. 
Under the mid-month convention, determine the month the property is placed in service.  
If it is July 2024, then the property is considered placed in service in mid-July (i.e., «on July 15»).  
Calculate the fractional annual depreciation by counting each full month plus half for July.  
Depreciable Basis = Purchase Price + Capitalized Costs − Land Value  
Annual Depreciation = Depreciable Basis / Recovery Period 
2) Commercial Property / Depreciation / for Federal Tax:  
2.1) MACRS:  
- Recovery period: 39 years.  
- Method: straight-line. 
- Convention: mid-month.  
2.2) If the property contains short-lived components (equipment, furniture, finish materials, etc.), a cost segregation study can be performed.  
This will identify items with 5, 7 or 15 year depreciation periods, which can increase the total depreciation in the early years.
3) Residential Property / Depreciation / for New Jersey tax:  
Just use the federal rules (see point 1 above).

4) Commercial Property / Depreciation / for New Jersey tax:  
4.1) New Jersey does not recognize bonus depreciation (§168(k)).
4.2) New Jersey disallows some §179 provisions beyond certain limits.
If an amount has been deducted under §179 at the federal level, New Jersey may require it to be reinstated and depreciated at the normal rate.
5) Residential Property / Expenses / for Federal Tax:
5.1) In order for expenses to be deductible for federal tax purposes, the property must meet one of the following criteria:  
5.1.1) «Placed in service» (put into operation) for rental.  
This means that the property is ready for rental, with an advertisement placed, a real estate agent hired, or a lease signed.   
If the property is purchased but not ready for rental, the expense may not be recognized (or may be deferred).  
5.1.2) Rental (or used in business).  
If a residence is rented out, then it is considered rental property.
If it is used as a primary residence, different rules and deductions (for example, mortgage interest and real estate taxes in Schedule A) apply.
5.2) Ordinary business expenses (current expenses) are fully deductible in the tax year in which they are incurred.
They include:  
5.2.1) Repairs that do not materially prolong the useful life or increase the value of the property but keep it in working condition (for example, painting or minor repairs).
5.2.2) Costs for utilities, insurance, property taxes, HOA fees, property management services, and others.
5.3) Capital improvements.  
Such costs cannot be deducted immediately; they must be capitalized and depreciated over the appropriate period, often 27.5 years for residential property.
5.4) Some closing costs can be deducted immediately, others are capitalized (added to the basis of the building) and depreciated.
6) Commercial Property / Expenses / for Federal tax.  
6.1) If commercial real estate (such as an office or warehouse) is rented to tenants, income and expenses are reported on Schedule E (Form 1040).
6.2) If the building is used for a business (such as a store or office), then expenses are reported on Schedule C (for a sole proprietorship) or on a partnership return (Form 1065) or a corporate return (Form 1120). 
6.3) Current (operating) expenses (ordinary and necessary expenses of maintaining the property in working order and conducting the business/rental) are deductible in the tax year in which they are incurred if the property is already placed in service, i.e. ready for business/rental.
6.4) Capital improvements do not qualify for immediate deduction and must be capitalized with subsequent depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the MACRS parameters from point 2.1 above.
6.5) Closing Costs (Acquisition Costs):  
6.5.1) Capitalized:  
- Commissions to brokers or agents upon purchase.  
- Title insurance.  
- Costs for title search (legal verification of ownership).  
- Recording fees.  
- Other transaction-related expenses.  
6.5.2) Deducted immediately:
- Mortgage interest for the period after the property is placed in service.
- Property taxes.
- Insurance premiums for the current period.
7) Residential Property / Expenses / for New Jersey.  
Expenses in New Jersey are treated the same way as at the federal level (IRS), so there is no decoupling for operating expenses.
8) Commercial Property / Expenses / for New Jersey.  
The differences from the federal level (IRS) are the same as in points 4.1 and 4.2 above.
