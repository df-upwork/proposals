There are 2 ways to solve your task:
1) Cloudflare Workers + an IP geolocation service.
The official information on the Cloudflare geolocation function (`CF-IPCountry`) does not provide segmentation within a country; so, it is necessary to do the following:
1.1) Get access to an IP geolocation service that provides data for Canadian provinces.
1.2) Create a Worker in the Cloudflare dashboard («Workers & Pages» → «Workers»).
Click «Create a Service» and then select «HTTP handler».
1.3) In the Worker code, make a request to the geolocation service (point 1.1), passing the user's IP address (which can be obtained from the `CF-Connecting-IP` header).
1.4) Compare the returned province code with the desired list of provinces that should or should not be granted access.
1.5) If the province is on the forbidden list, return the corresponding HTTP status (e.g., `403`). 
If the province is allowed, pass the traffic further.
1.6) Deploy the Worker and link it to your domain through the «Routes» settings.
2) A custom implementation on your website.
In the project tags, you specified «WordPress», so I will explain the implementation for WordPress below.
2.1) Install a WordPress plugin that supports regional IP geolocation.
Ensure that the plugin is compatible with Cloudflare.
2.2) Configure the plugin to retrieve the user's IP address from the `CF-Connecting-IP' header.
This is often configured in the `wp-config.php` file or in the plugin settings.
2.3) Get access to an IP geolocation service that provides data for Canadian provinces (similar to point 1.1).
2.4) Upload the IP address database (point 2.3) to your server (or use it via the geolocation service's API).
2.5) Create blocking rules (e.g., block all IP addresses determined to be from certain provinces).
