A change in the MySQL data schema is a very likely probable cause of your problem:
1) If a new field has been added to a MySQL table, it will not appear in your Power BI model until it is explicitly selected in Power Query.
2) If a field has been renamed or deleted in MySQL, but there is still a reference to the old name in Power BI's query editor (M-code), the entire report refresh process can be interrupted, and new data will not be loaded.
3) Sometimes (depending on settings), Power Query silently skips steps where it cannot find a deleted column.
4) A field may have changed its type in MySQL. 
If the key field is stored as `VARCHAR` in MySQL while imported as numeric in Power BI (or vice versa), some new rows may be ignored when matching values (in filters or relationships).
5) A table in MySQL may have changed its key column. 
In this case, the relationship may become inactive or flagged with an error in Power BI's Manage Relationships window.
6) If Power BI considers a field to be a key, but that field now contains duplicates in MySQL, the relationship will fail or become ambiguous in Power BI.
7) Some data may become isolated (inconsistent) in MySQL.
For example, a new row may be inserted into the `Sales` table, but the `Products` reference table may not have a matching record or key (`ProductID`). 
In this case, when Power BI constructs the model and relationships, it does not find the required record in the dimension, so the `Sales` row is left alone and may not appear in the report (especially if relationships are one-to-many or filtering is set to «Both»).
8) A quasi-cyclic relationship (through multiple intermediate tables) may have been created in MySQL. 
As a result, when using two-way filtering in Power BI, filters may automatically overlap and a portion of the rows (including new ones) may be excluded when selecting something in another slicer.
