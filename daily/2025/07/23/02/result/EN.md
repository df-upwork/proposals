1) I recommend the Phantom Equity (PE) structure for your case.
It simultaneously satisfies all of your requirements:
1.1) It preserves the company's status as a single-member LLC (SMLLC), as your angel investors will not become legal members.
1.2) It provides investors with the necessary economic incentive by tying their return to the company's value growth upon exit, which aligns with the expectations of angel investors.
1.3) It eliminates the need for partnership tax accounting and for providing investors with a Schedule K-1.
In points 3 and 4 below, I describe PE for your case in detail, and in point 2, I analyze alternative structures.
2) Reasons why other structures do not satisfy either your requirements or the expectations of angel investors:
2.1) Promissory Note: it does not meet the expectations of angel investors.
An investor's return is limited by a fixed interest rate, regardless of the company's growth.
Angel investors expect significant capital growth at exit rather than receiving interest income.
2.2) Convertible Note: upon conversion, the note holder becomes a member of the LLC, which destroys the SMLLC status and violates your primary requirement.
2.3) Revenue Sharing Agreement: it can significantly strain the company's cash flow because payments are made from gross revenue, regardless of profitability.
The definition of «revenue» can be complex and become a subject of dispute.
Many angel investors may find this model insufficiently attractive because it does not allow for exponential growth upon the company's sale.
3) With PE, it is necessary to understand and accept the associated compromises clearly:
3.1) Investors will pay tax on their income at ordinary income rates, which are generally higher than long-term capital gains tax rates.
This is an unavoidable consequence of forgoing a C-Corp structure and not providing a real equity interest.
However, for the investor, this drawback may be preferable to the complexities associated with receiving a K-1.
3.2) The PE implementation requires meticulous legal work to ensure compliance with §409A of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).
This complexity only arises during the drafting of the documents and is manageable, unlike the ongoing administrative burden and tax risks associated with maintaining a multi-member LLC.
4) My recommendations for the Phantom Equity Agreement (PEA):
4.1) Explicitly state in the PEA that the investor is not granted:
- member status (member)
- ownership rights
- voting rights
- any other rights except for those expressly listed in the agreement.

4.2) Specify the number of phantom units to be granted and their equivalent as a percentage of the company's value for calculating the payout.
4.3) Define the Liquidity Event (LE) that will trigger the payout, such as the sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets, a merger, or an acquisition.
4.4) Define the payment timing that complies with §409A (e.g., «the payment will be made within 60 days after the closing of the LE»).
4.5)  Define a formula or procedure for determining the company's value as of the LE to calculate the payout amount.
4.6) Define the Vesting Schedule: conditions (e.g., a term), upon the expiration of which the right to payment becomes non-forfeitable.
4.7) Prohibit acceleration of payments at the parties' discretion to ensure compliance with §409A.
