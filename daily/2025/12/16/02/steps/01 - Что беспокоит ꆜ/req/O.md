We are a rapidly scaling e-commerce business (Dropshipping/Brand model) operating via a US LLC, currently generating significant revenue (projected $10M/year).

I am an Italian citizen, tax resident in Malta under the Non-Dom program.

I am looking for a high-level International Tax Advisor or CPA with proven experience in Cross-border taxation (USA-Malta) to assist with a corporate restructuring.
The Current Situation:

• Owner: Malta Tax Resident (Non-Dom status).
• Current Vehicle: US LLC (Disregarded Entity).
• Business Model: E-commerce selling to the US market (goods shipped from China). No US ECI.

The Goal:
We intend to transition from a personal ownership structure to a corporate structure in Malta to manage cash flow and investments efficiently.

Proposed Structure: Cyprus Holding + Malta Trading Ltd (owning the US LLC).

Scope of Work & Key Questions to Solve:
We need an expert validation on the following strategy:

1. Fiscal Unit vs. Tax Refund: Validating the use of the Malta Consolidated Group (Fiscal Unit) to pay the 5% effective tax rate immediately, avoiding the cash-flow trap of paying 35% and waiting for the 6/7 refund.

2. Holding Location: Confirming the feasibility of a Cyprus Holding for a Malta Resident. We need to analyze the trade-off between gaining immediate corporate liquidity (Fiscal Unit) vs. losing the personal Remittance Basis on dividends.

3. US Compliance: Handling the transition of the US LLC from individual ownership to Malta Trading ownership (Forms 5472, 8832, etc.) and Transfer Pricing requirements.

4. Banking & Investments: Structuring the Holding to access Tier-1 banking (e.g., Swiss banks) for ETF/Stock investments.

Requirements:
• Deep knowledge of Malta Corporate Tax Law (specifically Consolidated Group Rules/Fiscal Unit).

• Deep knowledge of US Tax Law for Foreign Owners (Disregarded Entities, ECI, Branch Profit Tax).

• Experience with E-commerce/Digital businesses.

• (Preferred) Experience with Italian clients residing in Malta.

To Apply:
Please answer the screening questions below. Generic proposals will be ignored. We are looking for a expert strategic partner.

Screening Questions (da inserire nelle impostazioni di Upwork):

1. What is your opinion on using a Malta Holding vs. a Foreign Holding (e.g., Cyprus) for a Malta Non-Dom resident who wants to maximize immediate corporate cash flow?

2. Are you familiar with the Malta "Fiscal Unit" (Consolidated Group) rules introduced in 2020? Can you explain the main advantage over the traditional refund system?

3. Have you handled the transfer of a US LLC from a foreign individual to a Malta Company before?

We are looking for a Customer Service Representative in a US timezone with fluent English to handle customer support for our personalized jewelry online store.

### What makes this role unique?
Unlike standard customer service, our process involves custom jewelry designs, requiring customers to approve design previews before production. You’ll be managing multiple steps and coordinating efficiently.  

### What we need: 
- Proven experience in e-commerce customer service.  
- Strong Google Sheets skills (filters, navigation, multiple sheets).  
- Problem-solving mindset and ability to work independently.  
- Ability to manage high email volume (200+ per day) and quickly learn workflows.  
- Familiarity with Reamaze, Notion, Shopify, and fulfillment processes.  

### Work Hours & Expectations:
- 2-4 hours per day, spread across the day to ensure timely responses.  
- Initially handling fewer emails, with responsibilities increasing over time.  
- Potential for more hours in the future based on workload.  

📌 If you apply, start your proposal with "Jewelry CS" to confirm you read the full post.  

This role is for someone detail-oriented, fast-learning, and proactive. If that’s you, we’d love to hear from you!
