B2C Theme Customization for Netsuite and Adobe Commerce Integration
#### 1.1.2. Description
We are looking for an experienced developer to customize a theme for our B2C furniture business and integrate separately while using our existing B2B company and website's inventory from Netsuite. The theme should be user-friendly, easily editable, and integrate seamlessly with Netsuite and Adobe Commerce. The ideal candidate has a strong eCommerce background and a keen eye for design. If you can enhance our online presence, we want to hear from you!
Proposal Summary:
This proposal outlines the integration of Adobe Commerce with NetSuite to create a B2C website for Corp Design, referred to as "the client." The goal is to establish a new drop-shipping entity using Adobe Commerce, integrated with NetSuite, to manage product resales and order fulfillment. The implementer, serving as the Oracle NetSuite partner, will oversee the integration and theme design.
Prerequisites:
This theme or a theme provided by dev
https://clauem2.arrowtheme.com/at/
Upgrade the server to Cloudways to host the new website.
Activate essential NetSuite features: Custom Segments, Promotion Codes, Suite Promotions, and Auto-Apply Promotions.
Deliverables:
Website Theme and Configuration: The client will provide a theme that will be purchased and configured or replicated (https://clauem2.arrowtheme.com/at/) with all necessary sections and dynamic features. Additional customizations will be handled by the implementer. The website will support USD currency and be available in English and Spanish.
Header and Footer: Consistent across all pages, including logos, primary categories, and links like About Us, Help, Contact Us, Terms and Conditions, and social media links.
Homepage: Features a banner slider, top categories, trending products, hot product showcases, and a blog section.
Product List and Detail Pages: These will display product images, prices, SKUs, and quick add-to-cart options. The detail page will provide multiple product images, features, attributes, recommended products, and additional information like dimensions and care instructions.
Cart and Checkout: Includes product summary, quantity management, subtotal, shipping charges, tax, and total amount. The checkout page will integrate shipping and payment options, including Cybersource for credit, debit cards, and Apple Pay.
Thank You Page: Displays order completion messages and encourages further shopping.
My Account Pages: Customers can manage their profiles, view order histories, invoices, and RMAs. Each section provides comprehensive details and options for updating information.
Login/Register and Contact Us Pages: Facilitate user authentication and direct communication with the Sleek furniture team.
About Us, Return Policy, Help, and Terms and Conditions Pages: Static content managed through the Magento backend, providing essential company and policy information.
NetSuite – Adobe Commerce Integration:
Custom Segment Setup: A "Sales Channel" field will be used to categorize items, transactions, and customer records between Sleek and Corp, ensuring clear separation of data and operations.
Customer Sync: Real-time synchronization of customer data, including new registrations, updates, and deletions, between the website and NetSuite. Sleek customers will be classified as "Individual" in NetSuite, with a checkbox to identify guest customers.
Item Sync: Ensures real-time product data synchronization from NetSuite to Adobe Commerce, categorizing items for Sleek and Corp, and handling product updates and deletions.
Sales Order Sync: Two-way real-time synchronization of sales orders between NetSuite and the website, including status updates, payment mapping, and guest user handling.
Promotions and Tax: NetSuite-managed promotions and tax configurations will be automatically applied to sales orders on the website, with real-time syncing to ensure consistency.
Item Fulfillment and Shipping Method Sync: Fulfillment processes and shipping methods will be managed in NetSuite, with updates reflected in Adobe Commerce.
Cash Sale and RMA Sync: One-way synchronization of cash sales and RMAs from NetSuite to Adobe Commerce, ensuring seamless order and return management.
Error Handling:
A custom record will store synchronization failures, with retries scheduled every 15 minutes. Persistent issues will trigger email notifications to the administrator.
Assumptions and Scope Limitations:
The website will operate in USD and support English and Spanish languages.
Customer data access and some advanced NetSuite features (e.g., deposits, cheques) will not be used in this integration.
Risks:
Shared NetSuite account constraints may limit certain customizations, like logo display, and role-based data visibility.
Future changes in NetSuite's concurrency limits could affect real-time syncing scripts.
Post Go-Live Support:
The implementer will provide free bug fixes and issue resolution for the first few months post-launch, with additional services available as required.
