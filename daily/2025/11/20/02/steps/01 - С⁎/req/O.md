Dietitian or Nutritionist for remote work with European technology startup

### 6.3.3. Description
`P3D` ≔ 
```text
We have developed a new AI platform for dietitians in Europe (HQ in Dublin, Ireland) and we are bringing the platform to the US. We are seeking a dietician and/or nutritionist to help us navigate the process and help us understand the industry in more detail.

The job is not specifically about content writing - there was no option to select a category for Health or Health-tech. There is also no requirement to have any technology background and we are simply looking for consultants to help define a much broader strategy for the product and platform.

We have a relaxed approach to how we work and we are also flexible in terms of how to collaborate - just a few hours per week or potentially full time. The job will be fully remote. If you are interested in discussing please get in touch.
