1) Regulators will first review the Flow of Funds diagram to understand the core of the business.
The diagram must document each step of every planned transaction type, from receiving funds from the sender to delivering them to the recipient.
The diagram must also indicate which accounts (proprietary, transit, or partner) hold the funds and when.
2) Match the planned operations with the official FinCEN classification.
3) A license is required in each state where money transmission services are provided.
For a small company like yours (2-9 employees), attempting simultaneous licensing in multiple states is extremely risky.
4) Licensing requirements are vary significantly from state to state.
E.g., in Washington, the minimum net worth is $10,000, while in New Mexico, it is $500,000 for an internet business.
5) The choice of the first state for licensing affects not only the initial costs but also the company's reputation with other regulators, as they will see that the company has already passed a review.
6) The company's legal structure and financial condition must comply with regulatory standards.
7) The company must provide the Certificate of Good Standing to regulators.
8) Most states require the submission of audited financial statements for the last fiscal year, as well as for the 2 preceding years if the company has been in existence longer.
These statements must be prepared by an independent CPA in accordance with GAAP.
9) Most states also require interim (quarterly) financial statements.
They may be unaudited, but they must be dated no later than 90 days before submitting the license application.
10) For companies that have just started operations and do not have a financial history, the requirements are adapted.
In this case, it is necessary to provide an initial statement of condition and documentation supporting the method and source of capitalization.
Verifying the source of initial investments is the primary method by which the regulator can assess AML risk at the earliest stage.
11) Almost all states require a surety bond, which protects consumers and the state from potential losses if the company fails to fulfill its obligations.
12) Regulators require the submission of a package of documents describing the company's operational activities, management structure, and key personnel:
12.1) Business Plan
12.2) Organizational Chart
12.3) Management Chart
12.4) NMLS requires that an individual MU2 form be completed for each Control Person.
A Control Person is defined differently from state to state, but typically includes all direct and indirect owners with a share of 25% or more, as well as all key executives (e.g., CEO, CFO, CCO).
13) Implement and document an anti-money laundering program (AML/BSA program) that complies with BSA requirements:
13.1) Officially appoint a BSA Compliance Officer.
13.2) Develop an AML/BSA policy.
13.3) Develop a customer identification program (CIP).
14) Regulators require the AML program to undergo regular independent testing to assess its adequacy and effectiveness.
15) Develop a cybersecurity program based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).
16) Create a Written Information Security Plan (WISP).
17) Implement technical controls:
17.1) Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
17.2) Encryption
17.3) Antivirus software
17.4) Patch management: a procedure for the timely installation of security updates for operating systems and software.
17.5) Centralized access control: the use of systems that allow for centrally managing employee access rights to various resources.
18) Develop a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan (BCP/DR):
18.1) Business Impact Analysis (BIA).
Its purpose is to identify the company's critical business processes and IT systems and to assess the potential damage (financial, reputational, regulatory) from their downtime over various periods.
18.2) Business Continuity Plan (BCP).
The BCP is a strategic document describing how the company will maintain key business functions during and after an emergency.
It must address not only technical failures but also other events such as natural disasters, power outages, or pandemics.
The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed regulators' expectations for a BCP.
A modern BCP must mandatorily contain a separate, detailed section on «Pandemic Response and Remote Work Organization».
18.3) Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP).
DRP is the technical part of the BCP, focused on the recovery of the IT infrastructure and data.
The plan must contain step-by-step instructions for IT personnel.
18.4) Vendor Management Policy.
Modern FinTech companies are heavily dependent on third-party service providers: cloud providers (AWS, Azure), API providers, payment gateways, data verification systems, etc.
Each such provider is a potential point of failure or a source of risk.
Regulators expect companies to manage these risks as diligently as their own.
