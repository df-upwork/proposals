1) Neither of the structures you are considering is optimal for achieving your objectives.
In points 3 and 4 I outline their main disadvantages.
In point 5, I outline a structure that is significantly more effective for your situation.

2) Key definitions used in my analysis:
Malta: `M᛭`
Cyprus: `C᛭`
USA: `U᛭`
Cyprus Holding: `CHᨀ`
Malta Holding: `MHᨀ`
Malta Trading Ltd: `MTᨀ`
The Income Tax Act of `M᛭`: `ITA`
Place of Effective Management: `POEM`
Remittance Basis: `RB`
Your US LLC: `Uᨀ`
Your proposed structure «`CHᨀ` + `MTᨀ`»: `CH⧟MT`
Your alternative structure «Malta Consolidated Group (Fiscal Unit)»: `MH⧟MT`

3) Disadvantages of `CH⧟MT`
Registration of `CHᨀ` as the «Principal Taxpayer» in `M᛭` legally classifies its income as arising in `M᛭`, triggering taxation in `M᛭` regardless of residence.
Simultaneously, your management of `CHᨀ` from `M᛭` creates irrefutable grounds for recognizing its place of effective management in `M᛭`.
Under the tie-breaker rule in Article 4(3) of the `M᛭`-`C᛭` Treaty, `CHᨀ` will be deemed a tax resident of `M᛭`.
Crucially, this reclassifies dividends distributed by `CHᨀ` to you from «foreign income» to «income arising in `M᛭`».
You consequently lose the right to use `RB` for these dividends, facing full taxation in `M᛭` on an arising basis.

4) Disadvantages of `MH⧟MT`
4.1) Using `MHᨀ` with the payment of 5% tax results in the majority of profits being allocated to the «Untaxed Account», as the tax paid is insufficient to fully populate the «Maltese Taxed Account».
According to Article 61 of `ITA`, the portion of dividends paid from the «Untaxed Account» to a resident individual is subject to a final withholding tax of 15%.
This increases your effective tax burden from 5% to approximately 17.9% (5% CIT + ~12.9% WHT), making `MH⧟MT` economically inefficient.
4.2) Within `MH⧟MT`, the income generated by `MTᨀ` is legally attributed to `MHᨀ` and is classified as income arising in `M᛭` (ITA, Article 4(1)(a)).
For you, this means dividends are ineligible for `RB`, which applies only to foreign source income.
Such dividends trigger the 15% final tax liability mentioned above, regardless of whether they are remitted to `M᛭` or kept abroad.
4.3) You lose the method of protecting your assets from direct claims via a foreign holding.

5) A high-quality strategy for solving your task
5.1) Essence: `CH⧟MH⧟MT`
5.2) Implementation:
5.2.1) `CHᨀ` must own 100% of `MHᨀ` shares.
5.2.2) `MHᨀ` and `MTᨀ` form an internal fiscal unit, allowing the payment of consolidated tax at a rate of 5% immediately.
5.2.3) `MTᨀ` incorporates a new US LLC (`U2ᨀ`) and maintains its default classification as a Disregarded Entity to operate as a US Branch.
`U2ᨀ` purchases the business assets from `Uᨀ` at fair market value to cut off historical liabilities.
`MTᨀ` files a US Protective Return (Form 1120-F) claiming no Effectively Connected Income (`ECI`) to target a 0% US tax rate.
Alternatively, `MTᨀ` relies on the Derivative Benefits clause of the US-Malta Treaty to reduce Branch Profits Tax to 5% if taxable presence is asserted.
5.2.4) Profit, cleared of taxes (95%), is distributed from `MHᨀ` to `CHᨀ` without withholding taxes in `M᛭`.
5.2.5) You receive dividends from `CHᨀ` into a non-Maltese bank account.
These dividends remain tax-free in `M᛭` only if not remitted; any funds transferred to `M᛭` for living expenses are taxed at 15%.
5.3) Advantages
5.3.1) Maximization of corporate liquidity by targeting a 0% US tax rate via the Protective Return strategy or limiting US tax exposure to ~25% (21% CIT + 5% BPT).
This strategy avoids the ~33% effective tax burden inherent in a US C-Corporation structure while preserving the option for 5% tax in `M᛭` on non-US income.
5.3.2) Legal isolation of `CHᨀ` from `MH⧟MT` minimizes residency risk only if effective management is physically exercised in `C᛭` by local directors, preventing the creation of a `POEM` in `M᛭`.
5.3.3) Creation of a protected investment perimeter at the level of `CHᨀ`, which facilitates access to Swiss banking for capital accumulation.
5.3.4) Full legitimacy of using the 5% rate in `M᛭` combined with asset protection through a foreign jurisdiction.
