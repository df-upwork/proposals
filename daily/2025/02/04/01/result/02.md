1) Laravel does not use the `Authorization` header for humans: they log in via UI (a login form), and are then authenticated by session cookies.
2) The `Authorization` header is used when authorizing external programs in Laravel, not humans: for example, when an external program requests data from Laravel or updates data in Laravel.
External programs do not use a login form — that is why the `Authorization` header is used for authorization.
3) Since your Laravel application is new, it is most likely simply incorrectly programmed, and I can fix it in the programming code.
