Transferring FOSwiki to a new server is usually done as follows:
1) Installation of Perl.
2) Installation of the required Perl modules.
3) Installation and configuration of the web-server: https://foswiki.org/System/InstallationGuide#Step_4:_Configure_the_web_server
4) Transferring files.
5) Configuration of permissions and ownership for files: https://foswiki.org/System/InstallationGuide#Step_2:_Confirm_file_and_directory_ownership_and_permissions
6) Some FOSwiki sites use DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
In this case, it is necessary to install and configure this DBMS, and then transfer the database.
7) Transferring the database.
8) Configuration of the mail server: https://foswiki.org/System/InstallationGuide#Step_6:_Configure_email
