1) In your case, it is correct to use «Cost of services plus method» (26 CFR §1.482-9(e): https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.482-9#e).
2) I am sure that many will mistakenly recommend «Services cost method» (26 CFR §1.482-9(b): https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.482-9#b), however this method is also incorrect in your case, because it applies to «low value-adding» services, while you have «executive oversight, business setup, financial structuring, and strategy development».
3) In order to apply CUP or TNMM, it is necessary to find an example of similar services provided by independent suppliers under comparable conditions.
It is not obvious where you would find such an example in your situation, therefore CUP and TNMM are not recommended in your case.
In general, CUP and TNMM are very similar in essence: CUP compares prices, and TNMM compares operating profitability.
At the same time, they differ significantly in their approach to data collection: CUP requires direct price analogies, while TNMM requires a company benchmark.
4) For «Cost of services plus method», it is necessary to choose and substantiate the «gross services profit markup» on the cost of services of your directors in a competent manner.
The essence of the «arm’s length» approach is to keep accounting as if your directors from the UK were providing services not to your U.S. subsidiary, but to an American company independent from you.
Since directors would not work at cost for independent companies, it means that in your case, there must be a «gross services profit markup» in the financial calculations.
Big 4 (Ernst & Young, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) have standard rates for managerial and financial consulting.
Their gross profit margin is usually 20–40%.
For intra-group advisory, a slightly lower markup is usually applied.
In your case, I recommend 15%.
5) The correct «Reduced scope transfer pricing analysis» should look approximately like this:
5.1) General information:
5.1.1) Parties to the deal:  
- «Printspace Studios Ltd (UK)»: the parent company providing managerial and administrative services.  
- «theprintspace inc (US)»: a 100% subsidiary receiving services (incorporated in the USA).
5.1.2) Nature of the services provided:  
- Executive oversight
- Business setup
- Financial structuring 
- Strategy development
5.1.3) Amount and date of invoice.
5.1.4) Strategic objective:
- Ensure that this management fee meets the «arm’s length» principle in accordance with IRS Section 482 and can be documented in Form 5472, filed together with Form 1120 (the U.S. corporate income tax return).
5.2) Regulatory framework:
- IRS §482 
- Treasury Regulations, 26 CFR §1.482-1 and §1.482-9
- OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
5.3) Choice of method: «Cost of services plus method» (point 1).
5.4) Functional analysis:
5.4.1) Functions of the service provider (Printspace Studios Ltd)
5.4.2) Functions of the service recipient (theprintspace inc)
5.4.3) Conclusion on functional analysis
5.5) Calculation of the cost base (based on `Management fee recharge.xlsx`)
5.6) Supporting documents.
5.7) Substantiation of the «gross services profit markup».
6) «What would be the estimated cost and timeline for a reduced scope transfer pricing analysis?»
It will take approximately 15-20 working hours.
7) «Would this analysis provide sufficient documentation to support the management fee if reviewed by the IRS?»
Yes.
8) «Are there any best practices or additional steps we should consider?»
8.1) It is necessary to ensure that the data of «Transfer pricing analysis» are consistent with the accounting data and the data of Form 1120.
8.2) It is necessary to fill out Form 5472 in a competent manner, choosing the correct transaction code, specifying the amount including the markup, and avoiding technical errors.
8.3) Neither in the United States nor in the United Kingdom is it required to automatically attach «Transfer pricing analysis» to the tax return.
Instead, companies must maintain documentation confirming compliance with the «arm’s length» principle, and provide it to tax authorities upon request (for example, during an audit or when additional materials are requested).
