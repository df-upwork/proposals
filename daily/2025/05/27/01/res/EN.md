I do not work for $30-$50 per hour.
Also, I see that for the current contract you have a truly laughable hourly rate: $22.51/hr.
When you are ready to pay for my work in accordance with the hourly rate indicated in my profile — then I will consult you in detail about the applicability of dense vectors, HNSW, hybrid retrieval, Weaviate/Qdrant, etc. in your project.
A quality analysis requires hours of my work.
Previously I performed this kind of analysis right in my proposals and wrote detailed proposals of 10,000–20,000 characters, spending 2-3 hours of my working time on each proposal, but the clients with an hourly rate of $20-$30-$50 do not particularly appreciate it: they simply cannot afford my services.
