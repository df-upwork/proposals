1) Neither of the structures you are considering is optimal for achieving your objectives.
In points 3 and 4 I outline their main disadvantages.
In point 5, I outline a structure that is significantly more effective for your situation.

2) Key definitions used in my analysis:
Malta: `M᛭`
Cyprus: `C᛭`
USA: `U᛭`
Cyprus Holding: `CHᨀ`
Malta Holding: `MHᨀ`
Malta Trading Ltd: `MTᨀ`
The Income Tax Act of `M᛭`: `ITA`
Effectively Connected Income: `ECI`
Place of Effective Management: `POEM`
Remittance Basis: `RB`
Final Withholding Tax: `FWT`
Your US LLC: `Uᨀ`
Your proposed structure «`CHᨀ` + `MTᨀ`»: `CH⧟MT`
Your alternative structure «Malta Consolidated Group (Fiscal Unit)»: `MH⧟MT`

3) Disadvantages of `CH⧟MT`
Under Rule 6 of the Consolidated Group Rules, the income of `MTᨀ` is deemed to be derived by `CHᨀ` and is legally classified as income arising in `M᛭`.
Simultaneously, your management of `CHᨀ` from `M᛭` creates strong grounds for recognizing its `POEM` in `M᛭`.
Under the tie-breaker rule in Article 4(3) of the `M᛭`-`C᛭` Treaty, `CHᨀ` will be deemed a tax resident of `M᛭`.
Crucially, this reclassifies dividends distributed by `CHᨀ` to you from «foreign income» to «income arising in `M᛭`».
You consequently lose the right to use `RB` for these dividends, which triggers the 15% `FWT` on distributions from the «Untaxed Account» to a resident.

4) Disadvantages of `MH⧟MT`
4.1) Operating `MHᨀ` under the 5% tax regime results in the majority of profits being allocated to the «Untaxed Account», as the tax paid is insufficient to fully credit the «Maltese Taxed Account».
According to Article 61 of `ITA`, the portion of dividends paid from the «Untaxed Account» to a resident individual is subject to a `FWT` of 15%.
This increases your effective tax burden from 5% to approximately 17.86% (5% CIT + 12.86% WHT), making `MH⧟MT` economically inefficient.
4.2) Within `MH⧟MT`, the income generated by `MTᨀ` is legally attributed to `MHᨀ` and is classified as income arising in `M᛭` (ITA, Article 4(1)(a)).
Consequently, dividends are ineligible for `RB`, which applies only to foreign source income.
Such dividends trigger the 15%  `FWT` mentioned above, regardless of whether they are remitted to `M᛭` or retained outside `M᛭`.
4.3) You forfeit the asset protection benefit against direct claims provided by a foreign holding.

5) A high-quality strategy for solving your task
5.1) Essence: `CH⧟MH⧟MT`
5.2) Implementation:
5.2.1) `CHᨀ` must own 100% of `MHᨀ` shares.
5.2.2) `MHᨀ` and `MTᨀ` form an internal fiscal unit, allowing the payment of consolidated tax at a rate of 5% immediately.
5.2.3) `MTᨀ` incorporates a `U᛭` C-Corporation (`U2ᨀ`) to acquire business assets from `Uᨀ` at fair market value, subjecting profits to a flat 21% Federal Corporate Tax but eliminating the risk of the 30% Branch Profits Tax.
This asset purchase triggers an immediate Capital Gains Tax liability for `Uᨀ`, which must be budgeted as the unavoidable cost for effectively severing historical regulatory risks.
Dividends distributed by `U2ᨀ` to `MTᨀ` will be subject to a 15% `FWT` under the Derivative Benefits clause of the `U᛭`-`M᛭` Treaty, resulting in a total effective `U᛭` tax burden of approximately 32.85%.
5.2.4) Profit, cleared of taxes (95%), is distributed from `MHᨀ` to `CHᨀ` without `FWT` in `M᛭`.
5.2.5) You receive dividends from `CHᨀ` into a non-Maltese bank account.
These dividends remain tax-free in `M᛭` only if not remitted; any funds transferred to `M᛭` for living expenses are taxed at standard progressive rates (up to 35%).
5.3) Advantages
5.3.1) The `U2ᨀ` structure caps the effective `U᛭` tax burden at approximately 32.85% (21% CIT + 15% `FWT`), which is significantly more efficient than the 44.7% risk associated with a Branch structure (21% CIT + 30% BPT).
This approach provides legal certainty and banking access, avoiding the contradictions inherent in filing a «Protective Return» while actively trading.
5.3.2) The legal isolation of `CHᨀ` prevents the creation of a `POEM` in `M᛭` only if strategic decisions are demonstrably taken by qualified directors in `C᛭` and you abstain from managing `CHᨀ` from `M᛭`.
Given your current residency and active involvement, there is a critical risk that `CHᨀ` will be deemed a tax resident of `M᛭`, which would reclassify dividends as local income and nullify the `RB` advantage.
5.3.3) Creation of a protected investment perimeter at the level of `CHᨀ`, which facilitates access to Swiss banking for capital accumulation.
5.3.4) Full legitimacy of using the 5% rate in `M᛭` combined with asset protection through a foreign jurisdiction.
