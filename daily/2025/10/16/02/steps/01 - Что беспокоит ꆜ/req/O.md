Epic EHR Consultant for Referrals Guidance

## 2.3. Description
`PD` ≔ 
```text
We’re looking for a seasoned Epic EHR expert with deep, hands-on knowledge of Epic referral workflows to help our external clinic become a recognized referral destination within Epic.

We need someone who can guide us through the end-to-end process of enabling referrals to our organization — from understanding how referrals are initiated by clinicians to configuring our setup so that providers can easily refer patients to us.

Key responsibilities:
- Explain how Epic referrals work from both the clinician and IT perspectives.
- Identify which roles and permissions in Epic are required to create or manage referrals.
- Clarify the different types of referrals available in Epic and how each is configured (internal, external, work queue–based, etc.).
- Advise on what needs to happen within Epic (or at the health system level) for our clinic to be added as a referral destination.
- Help us navigate Epic’s support structure to find the right contacts or departments who can implement the necessary changes.
- Provide best practices for streamlining the referral process so that clinicians can easily send patients to our organization.

Ideal candidate:
- Extensive experience working with Epic EHR, especially with referral management, work queues, and inter-organization workflows.
- Familiarity with EpicCare Link, Care Everywhere, and EpicCare Ambulatory is a plus.
- Strong understanding of Epic configuration, user roles, and security permissions.
- Proven ability to work with or advise external clinics or partner organizations integrating with health systems using Epic.
- Excellent communication skills and comfort explaining technical details to non-Epic users.

If you’ve successfully helped organizations establish or optimize referral connectivity within Epic, we’d love to hear from you.
