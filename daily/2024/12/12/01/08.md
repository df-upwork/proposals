As you mentioned that your company is very small (“Small company (2-9 people)”), it would be more cost-effective for you not to invest a large amount of money into developing such a solution from scratch, but rather to integrate one of the ready-made services: Prisync, Price2Spy, Competera, Boardfy, Minderest.

These services immediately cover a number of critical tasks:

- **Built-in mechanisms to bypass captchas and blocks:** You don’t need to develop your own parser or deal with anti-bot systems — these services handle that for you.
- **Convenient interface and analytics:** Instead of creating your own dashboards and metrics, you get ready-to-use tools for setting price adjustment rules, analyzing data, building comparative charts, and generating reports.
- **Automated updates and scalability:** There’s no need to worry about complex infrastructure — the service updates data on schedule and scales as your workload grows.
- **Time and cost savings:** Unlike spending months developing your own solution, integrating a ready-made service takes only a few days or weeks, reducing expenses and speeding up your time-to-market.

As for how these services perform parsing and determine what data to extract from a given page:

- **Manual configuration:** You specify competitor URLs and the required page elements (price, title, SKU, etc.) using technical parameters (e.g., CSS selectors or XPath). This method requires understanding HTML structure.

- **Semi-automatic (point-and-click) tools:** Instead of manually entering selectors, you simply click on the desired elements on the page in a visual interface. The service will identify the technical parameters and regularly extract the data. This simplifies the process and doesn’t require deep technical knowledge.

- **Predefined templates:** For popular resources, the services already know where to find prices and other key data, significantly simplifying the setup.

- **Algorithmic or ML-based approach:** More advanced platforms use machine learning to automatically recognize and adapt to changes in page structures. If a competitor’s site changes, the service either notifies you of the need to adjust the settings or updates the template itself (in the case of well-known resources).
