1) In New Jersey, «pre-foreclosure» is not a court order or judgment that can be «vacated».
«Vacating» applies exclusively to court orders and judgments, and not to procedural stages.
2) «Pre-foreclosure» is the initial stage of the foreclosure process, which begins after the borrower defaults on mortgage payments, and lasts until the lender formally initiates legal proceedings by filing a Foreclosure Complaint.
This period serves as a warning phase, providing the homeowner with an opportunity to remedy the default and negotiate alternative solutions with the lender, such as a loan modification, to avoid a formal lawsuit.
A key event at this stage is when the lender sends the borrower an official «Notice of Intention to Foreclose» (which must be sent at least 30 days before filing the complaint).
3) The standard foreclosure process in New Jersey is as follows:
3.1) Default on payments.
3.2) The lender serves the debtor with a «Notice of Intention to Foreclose.
3.3) The lender files a «Foreclosure Complaint» with the court.
3.4)  The court issues an «Entry of Default» if the debtor does not respond to the complaint within 35 days.
3.5) The creditor files a motion for entry of «Motion for Final Judgment».
3.6) The court renders «Entry of Final Judgment».
3.7) The court issues a «Writ of Execution» and schedules sheriff's sale.
