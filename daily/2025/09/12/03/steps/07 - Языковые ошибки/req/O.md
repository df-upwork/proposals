Need guidance on GST/HST filing in Canada

`P2D` ≔ 
```text
We have a small entity in Canada. We could use guidance on how to record and report GST/HST in Canada. Our clients pay us GST. We also pay GST to our vendors. My assumption is that the net GST is to be paid to the Canada Revenue Agency. What forms are to be filled for this? How do we track GST payable in Quickbooks. If I am based out in British Columbia but our vendor is based out of Ontario region, do we need to do reporting to Federal authorities or to Ontario authorities? Need guidance on topics like this

```text
I am entering into a contract with a company (ABC Group) for staffing an IT Resource. MSA has a Non Compete clause included. However, I am already working at the same client through a different partner. I have requested ABC Group to edit their MSA but they are not willing to do so. Instead they offered to sign an addendum that will allow me to work at the same client through more than one vendor partner.
This MSA is governed by State of New York jurisdiction. Would be nice to be worked by someone who is familiar with State of New York interpretation

Request content editing for an Information Technology initiative

## 6.5.3. Description
`P5D` ≔ 
```text
We are working on building a non-profit initiative to motivate more people from minority communities underrepresented in technology to take up IT jobs.
I have put together some thoughts but I feel this can be improvised considerably. Audience of this brochure would be the prospective interns (Who want to know about the program), prospective clients (Clients who are willing to give opportunity to the trained interns) etc.,

I am looking at this as a two step process. First get the content ready and then follow up with a brochure design.

If you have experience working in the technology space, that would be an added plus. Also if you have experience promoting non profit initiatives that would be an added plus
