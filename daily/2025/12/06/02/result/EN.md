1) In your case, it is pointless to «dispute or appeal» the CBSA re-assessment: you will lose based on CITT NQ-2021-002 (hereafter — `L`): https://decisions.citt-tcce.gc.ca/citt-tcce/a/en/512053/1/document.do
2) §24 of `L` (hereafter — `L.24`) explicitly lists «sofa-beds» among the goods subject to `L`.
3) §23 of `L` cites the dumping margins (hereafter — `M`) determined by the CBSA for goods originating in China, ranging from 9.3% to 188%.
4) Cooperating exporters were assigned specific normal values that exempt them from anti-dumping duties if their export prices equal or exceed these values.
Pursuant to §21 of `L`, the subsidy investigation was terminated for specific cooperating exporters, exempting them from countervailing duties.
5) In your case, the anti-dumping duty corresponding to the upper limit of `M` (188%, hereafter — `U`) and a fixed countervailing duty of 1,390.65 CNY per piece (hereafter — `CD`) were likely assessed.
This combination of duties applies to non-cooperating exporters and all new suppliers from China that do not have specific normal values.
6) Your plan to import «regular sofas» is viable only if these goods strictly meet the exclusion criteria described in `L.24`(a): «stationary (i.e. non-motion) seating upholstered only with fabric (rather than leather), even if the fabric is a leather-substitute (such as leather-like or leather-look polyurethane or vinyl)».
Otherwise, «sofas» fall under the explicit listing in `L.24` and are subject to `U` + `CD`.
7) Below in points 8-9 I outline my expert recommendations for mitigating the consequences of your problem.
8) `R1`: duty drawback via re-export of goods
8.1) This is the only statutory mechanism to recover up to 100% of the assessed anti-dumping duties for goods currently in stock.
8.2) To eliminate the duty liability for unsold stock of sofa-beds, you must organize their physical export from Canada.
8.3) The right to a refund of duties is provided for in Section 74(1) of the Customs Act:: https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-52.6/page-11.html#s-74
8.4) It is necessary to submit an application using form K32 in accordance with Memorandum D7-4-2: https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d7/d7-4-2-eng.html
8.5) It is necessary to provide proof of export and evidence that the goods remained in the «same condition».
8.6) You may export the goods to the USA or any other country to claim the refund.
For exports to the USA, it is necessary provide proof of entry for consumption (USA CBP Form 7501).
CUSMA Article 2.5 restrictions do not apply to goods exported in the «same condition» (Article 2.5(6)).
Detailed guidance is available in the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Memorandum D7-4-3: https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d7/d7-4-3-eng.html
9) `R2`: negotiated payment arrangement with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
Immediately formally acknowledge the debt and initiate negotiations with the CRA to agree on a payment schedule.
This procedure is outlined in Circular IC98-1R7 «Tax Collections Policies» (hereafter — `TCP`): https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic98-1/tax-collections-policies.html
`TCP` authorizes installment plans, provided that proof of financial hardship is submitted.
The goal of `R2` is to conclude a written «payment arrangement», which will suspend enforcement measures, such as «garnishment».
It is necessary to contact the collections officer indicated in the notice and provide full financial disclosure to justify the payment schedule.
