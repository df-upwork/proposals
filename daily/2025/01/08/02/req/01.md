#### Title
DevOps Expert needed to help resolve an SSH access & Server Configuration Issue (URGENT)
#### Description
We are facing a critical issue with an EC2 instance in our AWS environment after attempting to update SSL certificates and configuration files. Here's a detailed breakdown of the situation:
Context:
    1. The issue arose after testing the Nginx configuration (sudo nginx -t) on an Ubuntu EC2 instance.
    2. Post-command execution, the SSH connection to the instance was lost, and we are now unable to log back in using the SSH key.
    3. There is a possibility that changes to Nginx, the SSL configuration, or SSH-related files caused the issue.
    4. To recover access and resolve the issue, we mounted the volume to a temporary EC2 instance but encountered errors.
We need someone to:
1. Restore Access to the Original Instance:
    - Diagnose and resolve the SSH access issue.
    - Verify if any Nginx, SSL, or SSH configurations are causing the problem.
2. Recover Data from the Secondary Volume:
    - Troubleshoot the volume mounting issue on a temporary EC2 instance.
    - If necessary, repair or recover the filesystem to access the data.
You will work alongside our backend dev who will provide all context/info you need to resolve.
This is a one-time job but we are planning DevOps work in future so may lead to more jobs.
Need someone today.
