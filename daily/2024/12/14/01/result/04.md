Unfortunately, there is no “magical” solution on the market where I can simply input your website and your competitors’ URLs and have everything fully set up without any input from you. Even the most advanced solutions require at least a minimal onboarding and configuration phase. However, some options aim to simplify this process as much as possible through machine learning and preconfigured templates.

- **Competera:** Focuses on automation and ML. It offers fairly “smart” automatic matching of competitor products. Initially, some confirmation of matches or parameter settings may be needed, but afterwards the system can operate with minimal manual effort.

- **Minderest:** Also uses machine learning and advanced algorithms for competitor analysis. It can independently identify the necessary elements on pages and adapt to structural changes. Still, as with Competera, a small amount of initial manual input might be required.

Bottom line: There’s no fully plug-and-play solution yet, but Competera and Minderest come closest, thanks to their advanced ML capabilities and support.

Moreover, all these mentioned systems (and similar ones) provide an API for integration. By leveraging their API, I can automate interactions with the service: supplying product lists, uploading new competitor URLs, retrieving monitoring results, and applying custom data processing rules. This will further reduce your involvement and manual work, and improve the accuracy of automatic matching by providing a more comprehensive set of input data.

In conclusion, I can find and configure the optimal service for you and, if necessary, enhance its functionality through the API to approach a fully automated solution, minimizing your participation in the process.
