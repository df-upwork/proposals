1) If you try to perform this task «as quickly as possible», by bombarding the UPS or FedEx server with 100.000 requests at once — then you will most likely get your account banned or temporarily frozen by UPS and FedEx.  
2) The real solution to your problem:  
2.1) Carefully examine the exact quotas of your specific UPS and FedEx accounts: how many requests their APIs allow you to send per minute, hour, day, and week according to each carrier’s rules.  
2.2) Carefully implement a software solution that interacts with the UPS and FedEx APIs strictly within the quotas identified in point 2.1 and in no other way.  
Any account blockage, even a temporary one, is immediately a major waste of time in performing your task, so by rushing your task, you will only prolong the entire process.  
3) The software solution described in point 2.2 is significantly more complex than simply firing off 100.000 requests in a loop (and getting banned),  so any simplistic completion estimates that some developers would give you (like 1 day) is a reliable indicator of their lack of competence in this matter.  
4) I think the 2.2 implementation will take about 5 days.
