The 3 reports can be implemented as follows:
1) «Display Logins per User»
1.1) A standard WordPress installation does not keep track of login events.
The BuddyPress and bbPress plugins you use (you mentioned them in your other projects on Upwork) also do not keep track of login events.
Therefore, in order to keep track of login events, it is necessary to install a special plugin (for example, «WP Security Audit Log»): only then login events will be recorded.
It is possible that a similar plugin is already installed in your WordPress: in this case, the «Display Logins per User» report will contain historical data.
1.2) Set up the transfer of login events from WordPress to Power BI using Fabric / OneLake.
1.2.1) Set up a «Data Pipeline» from the WordPress database table that stores login events (see point 1.1) to Fabric / OneLake.
1.2.2) Set up a connection from Power BI to Fabric / OneLake to pass login events.
1.3) Create the data model in Power BI:
1.3.1) The `Logins` table with the following fields:
- `LoginID` (unique record ID if any)
- `UserID` (reference to the user)
- `LoginDateTime` (login date/time)
- (optional) IP, device info, login method if a more detailed analysis is required.
1.3.2) The `Users` table with the following fields:
- `UserID` (key)
- name, email
- reference to Salesforce membership (if you need it)
- other information (role, BuddyPress group, etc.).
1.3.3) The relationship: `Logins[UserID]` → `Users[UserID]` (many-to-one).
1.4) Create the report.
2) «Display Search requests performed per User»
2.1) Similarly to point 1.1, a standard WordPress installation does not keep track of search requests.
The BuddyPress and bbPress plugins you use also do not keep track of search requests.
Therefore, in order to keep track of search requests, it is necessary to install a special plugin (for example, «Relevanssi» or «SearchWP»); only then will search requests be recorded.
It is possible that a similar plugin is already installed in your WordPress for these purposes: in that case, the «Display Search requests performed per User» report will contain historical data.
2.2) Set up the data transfer of search requests from WordPress to Power BI through Fabric / OneLake (similar to point 1.2).
2.3) Create the data model in Power BI:
2.3.1) The `SearchRequests` table with the following fields:
- `SearchID` (unique key (if any)),
- `UserID` (the user who performed the search),
- `SearchDateTime` (the date and time),
- `SearchTerm` (the search request itself),
- (optional) `ResultsCount`, `IP`, `Referrer`, `GroupID` (if BuddyPress), etc.
2.3.2) The relationship is: `SearchRequests[UserID]` → `Users[UserID]` (many-to-one).
2.4) Create the report.
3) «Total number of “Replies” per “Topic” posted»
3.1) The management of topics and replies is handled by bbPress.
3.1.1) For this purpose, bbPress uses the standard WordPress `wp_posts` table:
- topics have `post_type = 'topic'`.
- replies have `post_type = 'reply'`.
Each `wp_posts` record has the fields:
- `ID` (unique identifier — in the context of bbPress this is `TopicID` or `ReplyID`),
- `post_author`, `post_date`, `post_content`, `post_title`, `post_status`, `post_type`, etc.
3.1.2) The `wp_postmeta` table stores the connections between topics and replies.
3.2) Set up the transfer of topics, replies, and their relationships from WordPress to Power BI through Fabric / OneLake (similar to point 1.2).
3.3) Create the data model in Power BI:
3.3.1) The `Topics` table
3.3.2) The `Replies` table
3.3.3) The relationship: `Replies[TopicID]` → `Topics[TopicID]` (many-to-one).
3.4) The measure «Total number of “Replies” per “Topic”» in Power BI can be defined as follows:
```DAX
Total Replies = COUNTROWS('Replies')
```
3.5) Create the report.
