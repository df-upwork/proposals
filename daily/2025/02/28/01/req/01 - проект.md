### 1.1. Title
Create a Company Partnership Agreement

### 1.2. Description
We need to add a clause preventing members from engaging in competing businesses for two years in all states where RestoreZone currently operates (Florida, Texas, California, North Carolina, Illinois, and Washington, D.C.). Additionally, if the company expands to new states in the future, those states should automatically be included in the restriction.
To ensure the clause is enforceable, here is a clear definition of RestoreZone’s Services:
RestoreZone’s Services
RestoreZone, LLC operates as both a General Contractor (GC) and a Consultant, depending on the scope of the project. The company specializes in property restoration, insurance claims management, and construction services, including but not limited to:
General Contracting (GC) Services (When acting as a licensed GC)
Roofing Repair & Replacement
Water & Fire Damage Restoration
Mold Remediation
Structural and Interior Repairs
Solar Energy Installation
Consulting Services (When acting as a consultant)
Insurance Claims Assistance
Damage Assessments & Inspections
Project Management & Contractor Coordination
Financial & Legal Coordination
Project-Based Operations:
When RestoreZone is a GC: The company directly performs construction, restoration, and repair work.
When RestoreZone is a Consultant: The company provides assessments, insurance claim guidance, and project coordination without handling construction work directly.
Former members should be prohibited from providing any of these services—whether as a GC or Consultant—in competition with RestoreZone.
2. Non-Solicitation & Non-Interference Clause
Former members should not be allowed to solicit or engage with:
RestoreZone’s existing customers, suppliers, or vendors
Any legal representatives, attorneys, consultants, or service providers introduced through the company
3. Clawback & Liquidated Damages Clause
We need to establish financial penalties and legal remedies for violations of the Non-Compete, Non-Solicitation, or Non-Interference clauses.
4. Vesting Schedule for Ownership
Membership interests should vest over time to prevent partners from leaving with full ownership too soon.
5. Buyout Clause (Mandatory Redemption)
If a member leaves, RestoreZone or the remaining members must have the first right to buy out their shares before any external party.
6. Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on Ownership Transfers
If a member wants to sell their stake, RestoreZone and its members must have the first opportunity to purchase it.
7. Restriction on Use of Company Relationships & Resources
Departing members cannot use company relationships, trade connections, or resources developed while at RestoreZone.
8. Mandatory Mediation & Arbitration
All disputes should be resolved through mediation or arbitration to avoid litigation.
9. Unanimous Decision-Making Requirement
All major company decisions must be made unanimously by all members, rather than by a supermajority vote. No single member or group of members should be able to make significant business decisions without full agreement from all partners.
10. Violation Consequences
If a member violates any of these provisions, they can be expelled from the company, and their equity will be redistributed equally among the remaining members.
11. Membership Structure Adjustments
New structure as of signing this agreement should be the following:
Tina: 20%
James: 25.33%
Edgar: 18.22%
Justin: 18.22%
Jason: 18.22%
If Tina Pei does not generate $200M in actual cash revenue in RestoreZone’s bank account by the end of this year, her shares should automatically revert to 10%, as previously stated in the agreement.
Clawback: so if Tina does not generate 200M in cash this year by 12/31/2025 she will go back to 10%  and remaining will be as follows:
Tina: 10%
James: 28.5%
Edgar, Justin, Jason: 20.5% each
