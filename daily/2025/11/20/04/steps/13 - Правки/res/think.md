8.3) Batch Synchronization (Scheduled Report Export).
This method utilizes ``S`` built-in reporting capabilities (e.g., Crystal Reports in Standard/Enterprise or customized reports in Select) to generate structured data exports (CSV or XML) on a predefined schedule.
The generated files are automatically delivered via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
This approach provides a highly reliable and stable mechanism for bulk data synchronization and full data reconciliation.
It fully complies with regulatory requirements (GLBA 16 CFR Part 314) and industry standards (ALTA Best Practices Pillar 3) by using secure transport protocols.
It serves as a robust complement to real-time integration methods (8.1 and 8.2).
