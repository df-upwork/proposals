At the strategic level, the failure begins with point 1 (inadequate COA) and point 2 (ignoring GAAP ASC 606).
These 2 failures create the necessary conditions for your problem, making accurate financial reporting impossible in principle.
Point 3 is the operational level of the problem: the uncontrolled use of Open Items becomes the instrument.

At the strategic level, the failure is the inadequate financial architecture described in point 1 (inadequate COA).
At the accounting level, the failure is the non-compliance described in point 2 (ignoring GAAP ASC 606).
These 2 failures create the necessary conditions for your problem, making accurate financial reporting impossible in principle.
At the operational level, the failure is the flawed process described in point 3 (uncontrolled use of Open Items).

Point 4 is the technical level of the problem.
It connects the incorrect operational input (point 3) with the incorrect financial architecture (point 1).
In parallel, point 5 is a separate problem.
It exacerbates the main problem and guarantees that even if points 1-4 were corrected, the bar revenue reports would still not reconcile.

At the technical level, the failures are the configuration and data flow issues described in points 4 (misunderstood hierarchy) and 5 (bar menu issues).
Point 4 connects the incorrect operational input (point 3) with the incorrect financial architecture (point 1).
Point 5 guarantees that the bar revenue reports will not reconcile even if points 1-4 were corrected.
