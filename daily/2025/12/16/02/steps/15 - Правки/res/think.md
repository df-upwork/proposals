# 1. Правка пункта 5.1

5.1) Essence: `CHᨀ` → `MH⧟MT`

# 2. Правка пункта 5.2.2

5.2.2) `MHᨀ` owns 100% of `MTᨀ` shares, and they elect to form a Fiscal Unit to pay the effective 5% tax immediately.
This configuration eliminates the cash-flow trap while keeping `CHᨀ` outside the Maltese fiscal perimeter.

# 3. Правка пункта 5.2.3

5.2.3) `MTᨀ` incorporates a `U᛭` C-Corporation (`U2ᨀ`) to acquire business assets from `Uᨀ` at fair market value.
This transaction establishes a stepped-up basis and triggers tax for `Uᨀ` only if `U᛭` authorities successfully assert historical `ECI` existed.
Dividends distributed by `U2ᨀ` to `MTᨀ` will be subject to a 15% `FWT` under the Derivative Benefits clause of the `U᛭`-`M᛭` Treaty.

# 4. Правка пункта 5.2.4

5.2.4) Profit flows from `U2ᨀ` to `MTᨀ` and is consolidated at the level of `MHᨀ` within the Fiscal Unit.
Subsequently, `MHᨀ` distributes dividends to `CHᨀ` without `FWT` in `M᛭`.

# 5. Правка пункта 5.4.1

5.4.1) The Branch structure would qualify for a 5% Branch Profits Tax under the Derivative Benefits clause, resulting in a lower effective tax burden (~24.95%) than the `U2ᨀ` structure (~32.85%).
However, the `U2ᨀ` structure is preferable as it offers superior legal certainty and simplified banking compliance.
