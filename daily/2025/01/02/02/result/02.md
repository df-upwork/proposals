1) The HTTP `524` error code is returned by Cloudflare: https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-5xx-errors#error-524-a-timeout-occurred
2) This error means that the server of your website has not responded to a request of Cloudflare within 100 seconds.
3) How to solve the problem:
3.1) If you really need to handle a request that may take your website 100 seconds to process, then you need to route this particular request outside of Cloudflare.
3.2) If you expect your website to respond quickly to the problem request, then you need to speed up your website by either:
3.2.1) Optimizing the website’s code
3.2.2) Increasing the server’s performance.
I can implement any of these solutions: 3.1, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2.
