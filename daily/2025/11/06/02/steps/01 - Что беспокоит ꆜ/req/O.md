Product Schema (JSON-LD) Specialist to Fix & Unify Shopify Schema

#
I am looking for an expert-level web developer to fix two critical issues with our e-commerce site's structured data (schema). 
This issue is causing two main problems:

## 1. Google Merchant Center Price Mismatch: 
We are trying to run a sale. 
Our product feed is set up with a price (original) and a sale_price. 
However, Google's crawler sees incorrect schema on the product page and, due to "Automatic Item Updates," it's reverting our products back to the original price, ignoring the sale.

## 2. Duplicate Product Schema: 
Google's crawl report shows it is finding three separate "Product" schema definitions on the same page, which are conflicting with each other and causing errors. 
This is likely due to a theme, an app, and custom code all trying to add schema at once.

#
We need a specialist who understands Google Merchant Center, product schema (JSON-LD), and how to debug these conflicts.

# Deliverables (Scope of Work):
Your job will be to:

## Audit the Page: 
Investigate our product pages template to find the three sources of the duplicate "Product" schema.

- https://elewell.shop/products/liposomal-glutathione
- https://elewell.shop/products/liposomal-nad
- https://elewell.shop/products/liposomal-nmn

## Consolidate and Unify Schema: 
This is the key task. 
The three schemas provide different pieces of information (e.g., product info, reviews, price). 
You must consolidate all valid and necessary information from all three into one single, complete, 'master' product schema.

## Remove Redundancies: 
Once the new 'master' schema is in place, you must disable or remove the other two conflicting schema blocks so that only one authoritative schema remains on the page.

## Fix the Price Schema: 
The one remaining schema must be corrected. The current, incorrect schema uses AggregateOffer (with lowPrice and highPrice), which is wrong for a sale. You will need to change it to a simple Offer schema.

## Implement Correct Sale Price Schema: 
The corrected Offer schema must correctly identify the current sale price. 
It should show the sale price as the main price so that it matches our Google Merchant Center feed's sale_price and resolves the mismatch.

# Required Skills:
Expert knowledge of Schema.org / JSON-LD for e-commerce products.

Proven experience with Google Merchant Center and fixing "Mismatched value (page crawl)" errors.

Strong debugging skills (you must be able to find and remove schema generated by themes, apps, or custom code).

Experience with Shopify

Clear communication and ability to explain the fix.

# Screening Questions (Please answer in your proposal):
##
Have you successfully fixed a "Mismatched value (page crawl)" error in Google Merchant Center before? 
Please briefly describe your process.
##
Based on my description, why is Google's crawler overriding our sale_price from the feed? 
(This will show me you understand the problem.)

- Identify and fix price mismatch errors
- Consolidate and Resolve duplicate schema errors
- Ensure compliance with Google Merchant Center guidelines
