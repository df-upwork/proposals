When development and testing is done on Windows for a long time without constantly checking the result on Linux (or vice versa), such problems happen all the time.  
In my 25-year experience, here is my ranking of the most popular causes:  
1) The champion of trouble, of course, is the slash mismatch: `\` and `/`.  
2) The silver medalist is the letter case.  
It is very easy to miss something like `I` instead of `i`: Windows will not complain, but Linux will fail.  
3) The bronze medalist is the library-dependencies.  
Perhaps, your problematic screen uses a library that is already installed on your Windows, but it is not present on your Linux environment.  
4) Apart from the top three medalists of the rating, there are some less popular causes that are specific to Electron: for example, differences in environment variables.  
What is funny is that the causes specific to Electron, nevertheless, lag significantly behind the universal leaders of my rating in popularity.  
5) I can fix your problem: it is unlikely to take more than 1 day.
