1) In points 3-7, I outline potential pitfalls in your situation.
In points 8-13, I outline my recommendations.

2) Key definitions used in my analysis:
Florida: `F᛭`
Florida Department of Revenue: `DOR`
Florida Statutes: `S⸙`
QuickBooks Online: `Qᨀ`
State Sales Tax: `SST𐏐`
Discretionary Sales Surtax: `DSS𐏐`
Tourist Development Tax: `TDT𐏐`
Transient Rentals: `R༄`
Marketplace facilitators (Airbnb/VRBO): `Mᚖ`
Landlord (dealer) in `R༄`: `L⌹` (your role)
Guest (consumer) of `R༄`: `Gꆜ`
Unjust Enrichment: `UE†`
Voluntary Disclosure Agreement: `VDA`

3) Submitting a flawed DR-26S application to `DOR` triggers a high risk of an audit exposing violations and leading to penalties.
Consequently, careful consideration of the pitfalls below is essential.

4) A common misconception regarding `DSS𐏐` concerns the «$5,000 cap».
According to §212.054(2)(b)(1) `S⸙`, `DSS𐏐` applies only to the first $5,000 of the sales price of a single item.
However, `S⸙` establishes a critical exception for `R༄`.
`DOR` clarifications unequivocally state that the limit does not apply to `R༄`.
Rental charges are subject to `DSS𐏐` in full regardless of the invoice amount.

5) A valid overpayment scenario involves geographical sourcing errors.
`TDT𐏐` rates are tied to the specific location of the property.
Applying the maximum rate in `Qᨀ` across all properties causes systematic overpayment.
Outdated reference tables in `Qᨀ` often fail to reflect rate changes, such as those effective January 1, 2025.
A refund is possible here but requires a detailed recalculation schedule for each transaction.

6) Under `F᛭` law, `SST𐏐` and `TDT𐏐` are consumption taxes borne by the `Gꆜ`.
The `L⌹` acts solely as a state agent collecting funds into a trust fund.
Any overpayment technically belongs to the `Gꆜ`.
Retaining a state refund without reimbursing the `Gꆜ` constitutes `UE†`.

7) `DOR` enforces strict `UE†` barriers: «Sales and use tax dealers must first refund the customer before seeking a refund from the state».
This requirement creates significant logistical challenges.
To claim a refund, identification of `Gꆜ` and documentation of refunds are necessary.
If `Gꆜ` cannot be located, `DOR` will deny the refund claim.
Consequently, these funds remain with the state and cannot be recovered by `L⌹`.

8) Since 2021, `Mᚖ` automatically remit taxes, yet manual `Qᨀ` entries often create duplicate obligations.
This overpayment originates from `L⌹` funds, rendering `UE†` inapplicable.
Consequently, a refund can be claimed without contacting `Gꆜ`.

9) Some `Mᚖ` remit `SST𐏐` to `DOR` but omit county-specific `TDT𐏐`.
This partial collection creates a liability to the county.
A valid refund claim arises only if `L⌹` erroneously remitted `TDT𐏐` to `DOR` instead of the local tax collector.
Establish the evidence by reconciling `Mᚖ` reports with filed tax returns.

10) Export transaction reports from `Mᚖ` and `Qᨀ` data for the last 36 months to perform a 3-way reconciliation: compare taxes withheld by `Mᚖ`, taxes recorded in `Qᨀ`, and taxes actually paid via DR-15.
It will distinguish duplicate payments from rate errors.

11) For double payments, prove `TDT𐏐` remittance by `Mᚖ` to eliminate the `Gꆜ` refund requirement.
For rate errors where `Mᚖ` collected the correct amount, the overpayment constitutes `L⌹` funds.
In this scenario, claim the refund directly without reimbursing `Gꆜ`.

12) Аile form DR-26S via the `DOR` portal.
For self-administered `TDT𐏐`, initiate a `VDA` process to settle liabilities and mitigate penalties.
Precise legal drafting in cover letters will prevent ambiguities triggering a full-scale audit.

13) Since `DOR` overpayments do not offset county underpayments, verify `VDA` necessity to avoid 50% penalties.
Participating in a `VDA` protects the business from license suspension and ruinous local assessments.
