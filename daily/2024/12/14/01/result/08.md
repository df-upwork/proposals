Unfortunately, there is no «magical» solution on the market where you can simply input your website and your competitors' URLs and have everything fully set up without any input from you.  
Even the most advanced solutions require at least a minimal onboarding and configuration phase.  
However, some options aim to simplify this process as much as possible through machine learning and preconfigured templates.  

1) Competera  
- Focuses on automation and ML.  
- It provides reasonably intelligent automated matching of competitor products.  
- Some initial confirmation of matches or parameter settings may be required, but after that, the system can operate with minimal manual effort.  

2) Minderest  
- Also uses machine learning and advanced algorithms for competitor price analysis.  
- It can automatically identify the necessary elements on pages and adapt to structural changes.  
- However, as with Competera, a small amount of initial manual input may be required.  

Bottom line: There is no fully plug-and-play solution yet, but Competera and Minderest come the closest, thanks to their advanced ML capabilities and support.  

In addition, all of these systems (and others like them) provide an API for integration.  
By using their API, I can automate interactions with the service:  
- Supplying product lists  
- Uploading new competitor URLs  
- Retrieving monitoring results  
- Applying custom data processing rules  

This will further reduce your involvement and manual work, and improve the accuracy of automatic matching by providing a more comprehensive set of input data. 

Your store's use of a PWA frontend is irrelevant for these solutions.  
Competera and Minderest will retrieve your store's data directly through the Magento 2 API, not by parsing your frontend.  
They only parse competitor websites (for pricing information), while relying on the Magento backend API to update your store's pricing data.  

In conclusion, I can find and configure the optimal service for you and, if necessary, enhance its functionality through the API to approach a fully automated solution, minimizing your participation in the process.
