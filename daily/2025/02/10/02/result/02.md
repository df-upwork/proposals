1) Your task is best solved by the `pt-online-schema-change` program from Percona Toolkit: https://docs.percona.com/percona-toolkit/pt-online-schema-change.html
2) This program allows executing `ALTER` for tables  without locking them.
3) Although this program is part of Percona Toolkit, it is compatible with RDS Aurora MySQL.
4) In your case, the command would be like this:
```
pt-online-schema-change \
	--alter="MODIFY COLUMN id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT" \
	--alter-foreign-keys-method=none \
	--nocheck-unique-key-change \
	D=<database>,t=<table> \
	--execute
```
