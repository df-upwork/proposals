Looking for a Skilled Developer (API & Webhook Integration) — Urgent Project

## 2.3. Description
`PD` ≔ 
```text
#
I’m looking for an experienced developer who can help me solve a very important part of my checkout process. 

# My setup is:
- Website: Showit
- Membership System: MemberSpace
- Checkout: I want to run this through ThriveCart for a more professional, high-converting experience

# What I need:
Someone who can integrate ThriveCart with MemberSpace using webhooks and/or API calls, so that customers automatically receive access to their membership after purchase — without manual intervention and without requiring an extra step like joining a free plan first.

## This means:
- Handling ThriveCart’s webhook data
- Creating or updating a user in MemberSpace via API
- Automatically assigning access to the correct membership plan
- Ensuring a smooth, elegant experience for the customer
-  Keeping everything automated & reliable

# Important:
I’m building a luxury digital brand, so the customer experience must be seamless and professional. 
## 
I’m looking for someone who already understands (or is confident with):
- API integrations
- Webhook workflows
- Membership logic & user access automation
- ThriveCart technical setup
- Ideally experience with Showit or MemberSpace (not required but a big plus)

#
This is a small project for the right person — likely a few hours of work — but extremely important for my business.
I am ready to start immediately and would love to see examples of similar work you’ve done.

#
If you have experience connecting external checkouts to membership platforms, please send me a DM with your personal approach, portfolio and rates.

# Important note:
Several people have already attempted to help with this, but without success. 
Therefore, if you do not have direct experience with API/webhook integrations or if you are unsure whether you can deliver this specific solution, please do not contact me. 
I am looking for someone highly skilled who can resolve this efficiently and professionally, without issues afterward. Your understanding is appreciated.

#
Thank you so much!
Marie-Eleonore
