1) Your fears are exaggerated: it is practically impossible to lose the inventory that is already in the Amazon warehouse.
Amazon is too big a company, so all the problems you are afraid of have already been happened many times in practice, and there are ready-made solutions for all of them.
2) Before using the «Delete Listing» option, write down the most important data:
2.1) The SKU under which the product is currently registered in FBA.
2.2) ASIN.
2.3) FNSKU (if applicable), as this is what is responsible for linking specific product units to your listing.
3) Take screenshots so that you have all the information about the product's availability and about its identifiers (SKU/ASIN).
In the event of technical issues or disputes with support, you will have evidence that the product was indeed in the warehouse, as well as information about the necessary identifiers.
4) Perform the «Delete Listing» action in Seller Central.
5) Do not use «Remove Inventory» — do not request a return or disposal of the product, so that it physically remains in Amazon's warehouses.
6) Wait for the period of time specified by Amazon (usually 24 hours, but sometimes it may take a little longer for the system to clear the listing for relisting.
This pause is necessary so that the old data (especially the manufacturer information) can be reset or updated in Amazon's system.
7) While the listing is deleted, you have time to lay the groundwork for the new product detail page:
7.1) Verify that the product information is correct: manufacturer, name, descriptions, key attributes, so that everything matches the SDS.
7.2) Correct the SDS (if needed) so that it does not raise concerns with Amazon:
Make sure that the manufacturer's name and all technical specifications match what is indicated in the new listing data.
If necessary, use an updated document or a letter from the manufacturer confirming the correct information.
8) Re-create the listing using the same SKU/ASIN.
Make sure that FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) is enabled and that the system recognizes your remaining inventory in the warehouse.
If Amazon recognizes that the SKU and ASIN match what is listed in its FBA system, it will typically pick up the remaining inventory in the warehouse and display that inventory in your new listing.
9) Send the new (or corrected) SDS (Safety Data Sheet) with accurate data to Amazon Support.
Include a letter from the manufacturer confirming the current product details and the absence of hazardous components.
Explain to the Seller Support representative that you have corrected all the information according to their requirements and ask them to remove or re-evaluate the hazardous status.
10) After creating the new listing, verify that the number of units in stock (Available) is displayed in your Seller Central in the Manage Inventory section.
11) Check whether the listing is shown as «Active» or «Inactive» due to the hazmat status.
12) If you see that the stock quantity has not been updated or the listing is still blocked, write to Seller Support right away, referring to the specific SKU/ASIN and requesting that they «reconcile FBA inventory».
Sometimes the automatic linking takes a while; if it has not worked, you should contact Seller Support and ask them to «link» the old stock manually.
13) Check the listing status periodically over the next few days or weeks.
14) If Amazon continues to consider the product dangerous and does not lift the restrictions, request a more detailed explanation.
There are situations in which Amazon requires additional certificates (for example, if the product has batteries).
15) In the case of a prolonged block, escalate the request: in some cases, contacting Amazon through the «Amazon Catalog and Product Data» category or through the support chat helps, as you can request a «Category Listing Report» and make changes directly.
16) After you have successfully restored the listing, make sure that all data (manufacturer, characteristics, SDS, etc.) fully comply with Amazon's requirements.
17) Do not make frequent changes to the product detail page unless there is an explicit need to do so.
Each change may trigger new reviews and increase the risk of the listing being suspended again.
