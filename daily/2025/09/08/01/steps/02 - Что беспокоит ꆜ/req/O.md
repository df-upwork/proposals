Tax Advisory Specialist Needed – M&A, QSBS, C-Corp Asset Purchase

## 2.3. Description
`PD` ≔ 
```text
We are acquiring a 50-year-old car wash business in the U.S. Midwest. The acquisition will be structured as an asset purchase, but we are exploring the use of a C-Corp holdco structure under the recent OBBB guidelines to ensure QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) eligibility for investors.

We are looking for a specialized Tax Advisor with deep expertise in M&A transactions, QSBS requirements, and C-Corp structuring.

The goal is to ensure our transaction is structured correctly so that investors can benefit from potential 0% federal capital gains tax on exit (after 5 years) while still preserving asset-deal protections and step-up depreciation advantages.

Key Areas Where We Need Guidance:

- Structuring a new C-Corp holdco and issuing stock to investors (QSBS clock starts at issuance).

- Ensuring the C-Corp can acquire the target company’s assets (real estate, equipment, goodwill, etc.) while preserving QSBS eligibility.

- Clarifying how depreciation and corporate taxable income would flow through under this setup.

- Confirming compliance with QSBS requirements and OBBB regulations.

- Advising on investor considerations, including protections, economics, and tax benefits.

Example of Our Current Thinking:

- Form a new C-Corp holdco; investors subscribe for newly issued stock.

- The C-Corp buys target company assets, giving us a step-up in basis for depreciation.

- Business operates as a C-Corp, so depreciation reduces corporate taxable income.

- Investors hold QSBS-eligible stock with potential 0% federal capital gains tax at exit after 5 years.

- Key benefit: investors receive asset-deal protections and QSBS upside at exit.

Requirements:

- Proven experience in U.S. federal tax law, especially QSBS rules and structuring.

- Strong background in M&A transactions and C-Corp formations.

- Familiarity with OBBB guidelines and recent IRS/tax court interpretations.

- Ability to advise both on structure setup and investor impact.
