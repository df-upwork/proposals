Computer Vision Expert for image detection model
### 1.2. Description
Our team is currently building an AI model . The objective is to detect surface defects like cracks, missing mortar etc. A total of 3000 unique feature rich images have been used to train the model using YOLOV11, but the DEV team is facing an issue with achieving low mAP score on training and even lower on test data which is far from our target of (greater than 80%).
We've tried dividing the images into smaller chunks but it has not improved the overall accuracy. I am looking for someone who has experience building image recognition models and can assist us as consultants to meet our tight deadline.
