Since Upwork has a response size limit, I have split my answer into parts.
1) First, let me emphasize the most important point.
The problem you are experiencing is most likely the result of another, more fundamental problem: your target audience sees no difference between your offering and those of the competitors who are copying it.
While legal measures can address the immediate infringements, the fundamental challenge lies in differentiating your brand so that customers clearly recognize its unique value.
2) Regarding the legal methods:
2.1) First and foremost, you must have properly registered intellectual property.
Having formal registrations significantly strengthens your legal position and simplifies the process of filing and enforcing IP claims across multiple online marketplaces.
In the United States, registration with the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office, https://uspto.gov) is a key requirement.
I can assist you with the USPTO registration process, from initial application to final approval.
2.2) Specifics for Amazon.
2.2.1) Amazon Brand Registry: https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry
On Amazon, intellectual property protection is conducted through registration with the Amazon Brand Registry.
A prerequisite is the registration of your trademarks with the USPTO (as mentioned in 2.1).
Once the brand is verified, the owner gains access to enhanced tools for monitoring listings.
The Brand Registry has a section where I can search for products that are infringing your rights (for example, using your trademark without permission) and file complaints about such listings directly through the Amazon interface.
The Brand Registry has a feature for submitting infringement reports.
Amazon reviews submitted claims and removes infringing listings when presented with clear evidence of unauthorized brand usage or product replication.
2.2.2) Project Zero: https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry/project-zero
For some brands, Amazon offers the Project Zero program.
This advanced Amazon program allows verified brand owners greater autonomy in removing counterfeit listings, leveraging Amazon’s machine-learning tools and a self-service removal feature once trust is established.
2.2.3) Amazon Transparency Program: https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry/transparency
The Transparency program assigns unique QR codes to each item, enabling Amazon to verify authenticity through scanning and guarantee your products’ legitimacy.
If a seller cannot provide these codes, their listing is either blocked or cannot be shipped to customers.
It makes it difficult for copies to be presented as originals.
2.2.4) Involving Amazon seller support and legal teams
If complaints via the standard Brand Registry tools are not effective or the situation is complex (for example, the constant appearance of counterfeits from different sellers), I can contact Seller Support or the special Amazon teams responsible for rights protection.
They may take stronger measures with indisputable evidence: blocking infringing sellers’ accounts and removing all their current and future listings.
2.3) Specifics for eBay.
On eBay, the eBay Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program is used to combat counterfeiting and protect intellectual property rights: https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/ebay-for-business/verified-rights-owner-program
It provides rights holders with tools to identify and remove listings that infringe their rights.
Concrete steps:
2.3.1) Registering for the VeRO program:
- The trademark, patent, or copyright owner applies to join the VeRO program, providing eBay with supporting documents (registration certificates, patent numbers, etc.)
- Once approved, you get VeRO participant status and access to special tools for monitoring and removing infringing items
2.3.2) Searching for infringing listings:
- As a VeRO participant, I can systematically monitor new listings that use your brand, logo, style, or other legally protected elements
- The VeRO program usually provides convenient forms or contact points where you can report violations
2.3.3) Submitting requests to remove infringing listings:
- Upon discovering listings that violate your IP rights, I will submit a detailed Notice of Claimed Infringement (NOCI) to eBay, documenting specific violations and infringing listings.
- eBay reviews the complaint, and if the violation is confirmed, it usually quickly removes the listing and may impose sanctions on the seller (warnings, temporary or permanent bans)
2.3.4) I can maintain a healthy ecosystem and keep copies off the platform by regularly updating your rights data and monitoring for infringements.
2.3.5) Preventive effect:
- After several successful VeRO complaints, many copying sellers either get blocked or stop trying to list counterfeit items
- Over time, this reduces the overall prevalence of violations and helps protect your brand’s assets on eBay

2.4) Specifics for Walmart Marketplace.
On Walmart Marketplace, combatting copies and protecting IP is done through the Walmart Brand Portal: https://brandportal.walmart.com
Main mechanisms:
2.4.1) Trademark Registration and Brand Portal Access:
- If you have a registered trademark (via USPTO), you can apply for access to the Walmart Brand Portal
- The Brand Portal is a tool provided by Walmart that helps rights owners find and remove listings that infringe their IP
2.4.2) Monitoring Listings via Brand Portal:
- Once I have access, I can regularly review listings that might be using your name, logo, or other trademarked elements
- The Brand Portal offers filtering and keyword search capabilities, making it easier to identify potential infringers
2.4.3) Submitting IP Infringement Complaints:
- If I find a listing with an infringement (for example, a counterfeit product or unauthorized use of your brand), I can file a complaint directly through the Brand Portal
- The claim is submitted to Walmart, including proof of trademark ownership (registration documents) and details of the specific violation
2.4.4) Walmart’s Prompt Response:
- Walmart reviews the complaint and, if the violation is confirmed, can remove the offending listing
- In cases of systematic violations by the same seller, Walmart may apply additional sanctions—from warnings to a complete account ban
2.4.5) Ongoing monitoring and data updates:
- Regular auditing of listings and prompt removal of infringing items creates an environment where the recurrence of copies is less likely
- By systematically using the Brand Portal, I can maintain a «cleaner» informational field around your brand on the platform
2.4.6) Additional Channels — Contacting Walmart Support:
- If, for some reason, action through the Brand Portal is difficult, I can contact Walmart Marketplace Support and its dedicated IP team
- In severe violation cases, external legal tools (Cease and Desist Letters, hiring legal consultants) can be used, strengthening my argument when filing a complaint
2.5) Specifics for Etsy.
On Etsy, combatting copies and protecting IP is done through the Etsy Reporting Portal: https://www.etsy.com/legal/ip/report
Main steps:
2.5.1) Formal Registration of Intellectual Property (Trademark, Copyright):
For effective protection, you need registered rights.
Without formal rights, filing complaints and their successful resolution become more difficult.
2.5.2) Through the Etsy Reporting Portal, the rights owner can specify infringing listings, attach proof of ownership (registration documents, original links), and submit the complaint for review.
2.5.3) Filing Formal Infringement Notices (NOCI) or DMCA Takedown Notices:
- I will file DMCA notices for copyright violations (photos, texts, designs).
Upon receiving a valid notice, Etsy reviews and removes confirmed infringing content.
- For trademark violations, I can submit appropriate claims with the registration number and details of the protected brand
2.5.4) Review by Etsy’s Legal and Moderation Teams:
- Etsy reviews the complaint and, upon confirming the violations, removes the corresponding listing or the entire offending shop
- Repeated violations may result in the offending account being blocked, reducing the future appearance of copies
2.5.5) Oversight and ongoing monitoring:
- I can regularly check Etsy listings using search queries related to your brand or unique product identifiers
- Systematic submission of complaints as new violations are discovered helps maintain the brand’s integrity on the platform
2.5.6) Additional measures (cease and desist letters):
I can escalate to formal legal measures for severe violations, such as issuing cease and desist letters.
This approach often deters future copying attempts and establishes a strong precedent for protecting intellectual property.
3) As a programmer, I can automate nearly all enforcement tasks detailed in Section 2 by leveraging the latest (December 2024) advancements in AI technologies.
What can be automated now?
- Continuous real-time monitoring across all marketplaces
- Automated detection of potential violations using image recognition and text analysis
- Systematic generation and submission of takedown notices
- Comprehensive tracking of enforcement actions
This automated approach provides significant advantages over traditional legal services:
- Immediate response to new infringements
- Consistent 24/7 monitoring
- Scalable enforcement across multiple platforms
4) Despite everything outlined in sections 2 and 3, the most critical issue remains the key problem identified in section 1. 
I can also address that problem after thoroughly analyzing your specific business.
5) Legal Licenses  
5.1)  
All the actions described in Sections 2 and 3 (submitting applications to the Brand Registry, filing infringement complaints, issuing DMCA notices, sending «cease and desist» letters, and monitoring marketplaces) do not require a U.S. attorney or lawyer’s license.  
These actions constitute administrative and pre-trial measures that right holders themselves or their authorized representatives (not necessarily attorneys) can undertake to protect their rights.
5.2) For USPTO trademark registration, an attorney’s license is only required if you are a non-U.S. resident (37 C.F.R. § 2.11(a): «Foreign applicants, registrants, and parties to a proceeding must be represented by a practitioner who is an active member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. State...»).  
If you are a U.S. resident, you do not need an attorney’s license for USPTO trademark registration.
5.3) Representing interests in court requires a lawyer’s license from a specific state.  
However, in the vast majority of cases, the measures outlined in Sections 2 and 3 resolve IP infringements without requiring court action. 
Considering that copyright lawsuits in the U.S. can be prohibitively expensive—and given your company’s small size («Small company (2-9 people)»)—it is unlikely to be cost-effective to pursue actual litigation.
