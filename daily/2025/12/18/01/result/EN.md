1) In points 3-8, I outline potential pitfalls in your situation.
In points 10-14, I outline my recommendations.

2) Key definitions used in my analysis:
Florida: `F᛭`
Florida Department of Revenue: `DOR`
Florida Statutes: `S⸙`
QuickBooks Online: `Qᨀ`
State Sales Tax: `SST𐏐`
Discretionary Sales Surtax: `DSS𐏐`
Tourist Development Tax: `TDT𐏐`
Transient Rentals: `R༄`
Marketplace facilitators (Airbnb/VRBO): `Mᚖ`
Landlord (dealer) in `R༄`: `L⌹` (your role)
Guest (consumer) of `R༄`: `Gꆜ`
Unjust Enrichment: `UE†`
Voluntary Disclosure Agreement: `VDA`

3) Submitting a flawed DR-26S application to `DOR` guarantees an audit exposing violations and penalties.
Consequently, careful consideration of the pitfalls below is essential.

4) A common misconception regarding `DSS𐏐` concerns the «$5,000 cap».
According to §212.054(2)(b)(1) `S⸙`, `DSS𐏐` applies only to the first $5,000 of the sales price of a single item.
However, `S⸙` establishes a critical exception for `R༄`.
`DOR` clarifications unequivocally state that the limit does not apply to `R༄`.
Rental charges are subject to `DSS𐏐` in full regardless of the invoice amount.

5) A valid overpayment scenario involves geographical sourcing errors.
`TDT𐏐` rates are tied to the specific location of the property.
Applying 1 maximum rate in `Qᨀ` across all properties causes systematic overpayment.
Outdated reference tables in `Qᨀ` often ignore rate changes, e.g. those effective January 1, 2025.
A refund is possible here but requires a detailed recalculation schedule for each transaction.

6) Under `F᛭` law, `SST𐏐` and `TDT𐏐` are consumption taxes borne by the `Gꆜ`.
The `L⌹` acts solely as a state agent collecting funds into a trust fund.
Any overpayment technically belongs to the `Gꆜ`.
Retaining a state refund without reimbursing the `Gꆜ` constitutes `UE†`.

7) `DOR` enforces strict `UE†` barriers: «Sales and use tax dealers must first refund the customer before seeking a refund from the state».

This requirement creates significant logistical challenges.
To claim a refund, the following actions are necessary:
- Identify `Gꆜ` within the 3-year statute of limitations.
- Physically refund the tax difference (e.g. 1% or 6%).
- Document each refund.
- Submit a consolidated application to `DOR`.

Funds from unreachable `Gꆜ` are subject to unclaimed property legislation and cannot be recognized as `L⌹` income.

If `Gꆜ` are unavailable, their contacts are lost, or bank cards are closed, you cannot simply keep the money for yourself.
In accordance with the unclaimed property legislation, these funds may be subject to transfer to the state under a different procedure, but cannot be recognized as `L⌹` income.

8) Some `Mᚖ` (e.g. Airbnb) remit `SST𐏐` to `DOR` but omit county-specific `TDT𐏐`.
This partial collection leaves the `TDT𐏐` obligation to `L⌹`.
This separation of duties forms the most promising evidentiary basis for a refund.
It is necessary to establish the evidence by reconciling `Mᚖ` reports with filed tax returns.

9) In points 10-14, I outline my recommendations.

10) Since 2021, `Mᚖ` automatically remit taxes, yet manual `Qᨀ` entries often create duplicate obligations.
This overpayment originates from `L⌹` funds, rendering `UE†` inapplicable.
Consequently, a refund can be claimed without contacting `Gꆜ`.

11) Export transaction reports transaction reports from `Mᚖ` and `Qᨀ` data for the last 36 months to perform a 3-way reconciliation: compare taxes withheld by `Mᚖ`, taxes recorded in `Qᨀ`, and taxes actually paid via DR-15 and county forms.
This analysis will distinguish duplicate payments from rate errors requiring refunds to `Gꆜ`.

12) For double payments, prove `TDT𐏐` remittance by `Mᚖ` to eliminate the `Gꆜ` refund requirement.
For rate errors, initiate refunds to select `Gꆜ` to establish a claim basis.

13) File form DR-26S via the `DOR` portal and submit local forms for self-administered `TDT𐏐`.
Precise legal drafting in cover letters will prevent ambiguities triggering a full-scale audit.

14) Since `DOR` overpayments do not offset county underpayments, verify `VDA` necessity to avoid 50% penalties.
Participating in a `VDA` protects the business from license suspension and ruinous local assessments.
