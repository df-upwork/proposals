                "text": "Policies are formal statements or principles established by an organization to guide decision-making and operational behaviour. They serve as the foundation for governance and compliance, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives and regulatory requirements. Unlike processes, which detail how activities are performed, policies establish the rules and frameworks under which those processes operate. A strategy describes 'what we want to achieve and how we plan to achieve it' while a policy describes 'what rules must be followed during strategy execution'. Strategies drive change and future outcomes while policies ensure consistent governance and compliance."
