I. Most likely causes of your problem:
1) CPU Burst Capacity
1.1) Essence
AWS Lightsail instances operate on the Burstable Performance model.
This model provides a low baseline of CPU performance with the ability to temporarily exceed it by consuming the accumulated CPU Burst Capacity.
If the CPU load exceeds the baseline level, these credits are consumed.
When the credits are depleted, the CPU performance is forcibly limited to the baseline level (e.g., 10-30% of a full vCPU's power).
This limitation (throttling) leads to a sharp slowdown in request processing or the complete unavailability of the website.
1.2) Rationale
The nature of the problem, described as «intermittent», perfectly matches the cycle of credit exhaustion under load and their slow recovery during idle time.
This is the most common reason for sudden performance degradation on Lightsail and EC2 T-series instances.
The baseline performance is often insufficient to serve a production WordPress website under load, especially when running background tasks or handling peak traffic.
2) RAM shortage and OOM Killer activation
2.1) Essence
The application stack (Apache, MySQL, PHP) consumes Random Access Memory (RAM) for its operation and to process requests.
If the total memory consumption exceeds the available amount of physical RAM, the operating system begins to use swap space.
Intensive swap usage (thrashing) drastically reduces performance due to slow disk input/output operations.
If physical memory and swap space are exhausted, the Linux kernel activates the Out-of-Memory (OOM) Killer mechanism.
The OOM Killer forcibly terminates critical processes (often MySQL or Apache) to free up memory, causing a complete website outage.
2.2) Rationale
Lightsail instances, especially on lower-tier plans, have a limited amount of RAM (e.g., 1GB or 2GB), which is often insufficient for a LAMP stack under load.
WordPress, especially with a large number of plugins, can consume a significant amount of memory.
A memory shortage is a typical cause of failures, such as a database connection error when the MySQL process is terminated.
3) Suboptimal web server configuration (Apache/PHP)
3.1) Essence
The Apache web server settings that control the number of concurrent processes do not match the available server resources.
If the `MaxRequestWorkers` (or `MaxClients`) parameter is set too high, the server can create too many child processes under load.
An excessive number of processes leads to excessive consumption of RAM, exacerbating the problem from point 2.
If the parameter is set too low, the server will not be able to handle the incoming traffic, which will lead to a denial of service.
3.2) Rationale
Standard Apache configurations (especially with mod_php) often consume too much memory for small servers and can quickly lead to OOM errors.
Tuning the balance between parallelism and memory consumption is critically important on resource-constrained servers.
If the server begins to use Swap due to a MaxRequestWorkers value that is too high, it severely degrades performance.
4) Malicious traffic and bots (Brute-Force, XML-RPC, DDoS)
4.1) Essence
Automated attacks and aggressive bots create excessive load on the server, consuming CPU and memory resources and causing a denial of service.
The main attack vectors on WordPress inT.mdclude brute-force password attacks on `wp-login.php` and attacks via the `xmlrpc.php` interface.
4.2) Rationale
WordPress is a frequent target for automated attacks.
Attacks on `xmlrpc.php` leverage the `system.multicall` function to check hundreds of passwords in a single HTTP request, which significantly increases the load and the effectiveness of the attack.
Attacks can utilize the Pingback feature to conduct DDoS attacks, overwhelming the server with requests.
The intermittent nature of the problem corresponds well with the patterns of attacks or bot activity.
Even low-intensity attacks can overload a small Lightsail instance.

II. What monitoring and alerting stack do you typically recommend for small production environments?
1) Native AWS Stack (Lightsail Metrics + CloudWatch Agent)
1.1) Essence
This approach uses exclusively Amazon Web Services.
Built-in Lightsail metrics automatically collect hypervisor-level data (CPU utilization, network, CPU Burst Capacity).
Collecting operating system-level metrics (memory, disk) and application logs (Apache, MySQL) requires the installation of the CloudWatch Agent on the instance.
Data is centralized in Amazon CloudWatch for visualization, alerting (CloudWatch Alarms), and log analysis (Logs Insights).
1.2) Advantages
This is the only solution capable of tracking CPU Burst Capacity (I.1)—the most likely cause of your problem.
2) High-granularity diagnostic monitoring (Netdata)
2.1) Essence
Netdata is an open-source tool for real-time system performance monitoring.
It is installed as a lightweight agent on the Lightsail instance.
The agent automatically discovers services (Apache, MySQL) and collects thousands of metrics with per-second granularity.
Data is available through a local web interface or the free Netdata Cloud service.
2.2) Advantages
The solution provides per-second granularity, which is invaluable for diagnosing the intermittent performance spikes characteristic of I.2 and I.3.
The agent is extremely lightweight, consuming minimal CPU and memory resources, which is critical for a resource-constrained server.
The installation is very simple and does not require configuration for standard LAMP stacks thanks to auto-detection.
The solution offers excellent, pre-configured visualization of all system components and application performance.
2.3) Disadvantages
The solution cannot monitor hypervisor-level metrics, such as AWS CPU Burst Capacity.
It is primarily focused on real-time troubleshooting rather than on the long-term analysis of historical trends or centralized log management.
The alerting capabilities are less flexible compared to CloudWatch or SaaS platforms.
The dashboard can be overwhelming due to the vast number of metrics presented.

III. «What’s your approach to finding the root cause of recurring Apache/MySQL downtime?» 
1) Advanced Resource Monitoring
1.1) Essence
This method is aimed at obtaining detailed metrics that are unavailable in the standard Lightsail monitoring, primarily the usage of Random Access Memory (RAM) and swap space.
This requires the installation of a monitoring agent, e.g. the AWS CloudWatch Agent, or the use of external systems.
1.2) Advantages
Monitoring RAM and Swap usage is absolutely essential to diagnose the conditions leading to OOM Killer activation (I.2).
The method also makes it possible to identify performance degradation due to intensive Swap usage (thrashing).
The method fills critical gaps in the basic Lightsail metrics, providing a complete picture of the server's resource status.
Historical data make it possible to analyze resource usage preceding the downtime and to identify trends such as memory leaks.
1.3) Disadvantages
This method requires the installation and configuration of additional software (agents) on the server.
Using advanced CloudWatch metrics or external services may incur additional costs.
Monitoring agents consume some server resources.
2) System Log Analysis
2.1) Essence
This method involves examining the Linux kernel logs (`dmesg`, `/var/log/kern.log`) and system logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `journalctl`) to identify critical events at the operating system level.
The main focus is on finding messages from the OOM (Out-of-Memory) Killer mechanism and service startup errors.
2.2) Advantages
The method provides direct evidence of OOM Killer activation (point I.2).
The analysis makes it possible to precisely determine which process was terminated and when it occurred.
Collecting system logs has a minimal impact on server performance.
Timestamps in the logs help to establish an exact chronology of events.
2.3) Disadvantages
System logs record the failure mechanism (e.g., OOM) but not the root cause of memory exhaustion (e.g., a traffic spike).
Critical messages can be lost due to incorrect log rotation configuration or a kernel buffer overflow.
Analysis requires SSH access and Linux command-line skills.
3) Basic Infrastructure Metrics Monitoring
3.1) Essence
This method uses the built-in AWS Lightsail monitoring tools to analyze the key performance metrics of the instance.
The main focus is on the CPU Utilization and remaining CPU Burst Capacity metrics.
3.2) Advantages
This method is critically important for diagnosing I.1, as CPU Burst Capacity exhaustion leads to CPU throttling on Lightsail instances (Source 10.1).
The metrics provide objective data to confirm the hypothesis of performance degradation due to AWS infrastructure limitations.
The tools are built into the AWS platform and do not require configuration on the server itself.
Historical data analysis allows identifying CPU usage patterns and the frequency of quota exhaustion.
3.3) Disadvantages
Standard Lightsail metrics do not include monitoring of RAM and disk space usage, which is critical for diagnosing I.2.
The metrics show the fact of CPU resource exhaustion, but they do not indicate which specific processes caused this exhaustion.
The low granularity of the standard metrics can hide short load spikes.
4) Application Log Analysis
4.1) Essence
This method involves a detailed analysis of web server logs (Apache `access.log` and `error.log`), database logs (MySQL `error.log` and `slow_query_log`), and PHP logs.
The goal is to understand traffic patterns, identify application errors, and determine inefficient database operations.
4.2) Advantages
Analysis of the `access.log` is critically important for identifying traffic spikes, bot activity, or DDoS attacks (I.4).
It allows identifying attacks on vulnerable WordPress endpoints (`xmlrpc.php`, `wp-login.php`) that create excessive load.
MySQL slow query logs directly indicate inefficient SQL queries that consume excessive resources (I.6).
Apache and PHP error logs record script execution failures, such as reaching the PHP memory limit or timeouts.
4.3) Disadvantages
The volume of access logs can be very large, which makes manual analysis difficult without specialized aggregation tools.
Application logs do not provide direct information about the use of system resources (CPU, RAM) at the infrastructure level.
By default, MySQL slow query logging may be disabled and requires configuration.
5) Stack Configuration Audit
5.1) Essence
This method involves an audit of the Apache, MySQL, and PHP configurations against the available server resources (RAM and CPU).
In Apache, the MPM module parameters are analyzed, such as `MaxRequestWorkers` or `MaxClients` (I.3).
In MySQL, parameters that affect memory consumption are checked, primarily the buffer pool size (`innodb_buffer_pool_size`).
5.2) Advantages
A suboptimal configuration is often a key factor in instability on resource-constrained servers.
Correctly tuning the Apache MPM can prevent the creation of an excessive number of processes that leads to memory exhaustion (I.2).
Optimizing the MySQL configuration allows for a balance between database performance and the overall memory consumption by the system.
Adjusting the configuration can improve stability without the need to scale the hardware.
5.3) Disadvantages
The optimal configuration is highly dependent on the workload characteristics, which are often unknown at the initial stage of diagnostics.
The method requires expertise in Apache administration and MySQL performance tuning.
Making configuration changes without understanding the root cause of the problem can exacerbate the situation.
6) Application and Database Profiling
6.1) Essence
This method involves using specialized tools to analyze WordPress performance at the code and database query level.
Plugins (e.g., Query Monitor) or external Application Performance Monitoring (APM) services are used to identify slow PHP code and resource-intensive SQL queries.
6.2) Advantages
Profiling precisely identifies the specific plugin, theme, or code fragment responsible for high resource consumption.
The method reveals the fundamental causes of the application's inefficiency.
Code and query optimization provides a long-term solution to the performance problem.
6.3) Disadvantages
Profiling tools add significant load to the server, which can exacerbate stability issues during the analysis.
External APM solutions can be complex to configure and costly.
Profiling does not identify problems at the infrastructure level (I.1) or external attacks (I.4).
Profiling results require WordPress development experience for interpretation and correction.
