```text
#
I’m the owner of a growing destination wedding business in Hawaii, and I’m preparing to expand to new locations (e.g., Maui, Big Island, and eventually the mainland U.S.).

#
I’m looking for a consultant who can help me design the right business entity structure to support this growth — focused on scalability, liability protection, and tax efficiency.

#
Specifically, I want help creating a clear Parent Holding Company + Subsidiary LLC structure (or other) that will:
- Allow profits from one location to fund new locations pre-tax
- Keep liability isolated between each location
- Simplify future S-Corp elections or restructuring
- Align with future CPA and tax attorney recommendations

# 🧠 Ideal Expertise:
- Strong background in U.S. small business structuring (LLC, S-Corp, holding companies)
- Familiarity with multi-entity operations and pass-through taxation
- Experience advising service-based or creative businesses
- Understanding of pre-tax reinvestment strategies and liability management
- Can explain structure and reasoning clearly and simply

#
This is a planning and advisory project (not legal filing work). 
The goal is to create a written structure plan and roadmap I can take to my attorney and CPA for implementation.

# Deliverables
- Written outline of recommended entity structure (Parent + Subsidiaries) (or other)
- Diagram showing ownership and cash flow
- High-level explanation of how profits move between entities
- Step-by-step sequence of setup (what to form first, and when to add others)
- Recommendations for bookkeeping flow and tax preparation coordination
- A short summary of key discussions to have with a tax attorney and CPA
