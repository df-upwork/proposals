The Python implementation:
1) Prepare an Excel file with the helical pile parameters:
- pipe diameter (in mm).
- pipe thickness (in mm).
- helix diameter (in mm).
- helix length (in meters).
It is better to specify all values in the metric system from the start, as required by the Ontario Building Code and NBCC.
2) Import the `pandas` library.
3) Call `pandas.read_excel`.
4) Import the `win32com.client` library (for interaction with AutoCAD via COM).
5) Create an AutoCAD application object using `win32com.client.Dispatch("AutoCAD.Application")`.
6) Set the `Visible` property to True to control the execution process.
7) Create a new AutoCAD document by calling `Documents.Add()`.
Set the measurement units for this document to millimeters.
8) Get a reference to `ModelSpace`: `doc.ModelSpace`.
9) Add a center line in ModelSpace to indicate the pile shaft by calling `AddLine`.
10) Add a conditional contour of the pipe (in 2D a single projection is sufficient) by calling `AddCircle` or `AddArc` to represent the pipe cross section.
Use «pipe diameter» and «pipe thickness» from point 1.
11) Add the helix in a simplified form.
11.1) Call  `AddCircle` (to show the top view) or `AddArc` (to show the side view).
Use «helix diameter» and «helix length» from point 1.
11.2) Consider the single/double/triple helix option: for multiple helices, repeat this operation at different coordinates.
12) Determine the helix coordinates and its placement relative to the pipe.
13) Check that the main elements are correctly positioned, taking into account engineering requirements.
14) Add dimensions.
Call `AddDimAligned`, `AddDimRotated`, `AddLeader` to specify the distances between key points:  overall pile length and pipe diameter.
If a circle is shown in the 2D view, it is possible to apply an Aligned Dimension in a typical cross section.
15) Apply styles to dimensions using the `Dimensions` object.
In the style properties, set the units to millimeters and, if necessary, add the suffix "mm" to the dimension text.
16) Add annotations by calling `AddText` or `AddMText`.
17) Assign styles to the annotations using the `TextStyles` object.
18) Call `ExportToPDF` (if using AutoCAD ≥ 2017.1) to create the final PDF file.
In AutoCAD < 2017.1  the PDF creation is done in a more complex way, using `PlotToFile`.
