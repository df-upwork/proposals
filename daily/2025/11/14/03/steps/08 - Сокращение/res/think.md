5.3) Negotiated Surcharge
This involves paying the POTW a surcharge for wastewater exceeding domestic standards.
However, under `L`, surcharges cannot authorize discharges causing «Interference» (hereafter — `I`) with the POTW.
`I` (40 CFR 403.3(k)) means disrupting the POTW and causing permit violations.
Your wastewater's extreme characteristics (pH 11-12 and BOD ~70,000 mg/L) guarantee `I`.
Federal law (40 CFR 403.5(b)(4)) specifically prohibits discharges causing `I`.
The POTW cannot legally accept payment in exchange for allowing this federal violation.
