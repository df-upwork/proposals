1) I have completed 500+ Magento projects here on Upwork.
2) I can develop a software solution to regularly update the products in your store from your supplier's website, instead of a one-time import.
This solution will be fully automated, requiring no manual intervention.
3) First of all, I strongly recommend negotiating with your supplier.
Your supplier is your partner, and it is mutually beneficial to build a win-win relationship that does not negatively impact their website.
4) Your supplier will undoubtedly disapprove of the crude scraping methods that 95% of applicants to this project will surely assume and employ.
Sooner or later, the supplier will notice that their website performance is negatively impacted during such scraping.
Then the supplier, just like you, will come to Upwork and post a job: «I need to block the bots that are overloading my server».
Do you want this?
Unlikely, as this would jeopardize your relationship with the supplier and the stability of your data source.
5) So, continuing the thought from point 3: the first correct step is to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with your supplier.
No supplier in 2025 manages their website's content without an underlying structured data source.
If a supplier populates their website, it means that they already have a structured data source that feeds the website.
It is highly beneficial for you to obtain this data directly from your supplier regularly in a structured format (at least Excel).
A reasonable supplier will find it beneficial to cooperate: by doing so, they boost their own sales and eliminate the problem from point 4.
6) If the supplier turns out to be unreasonable (which is rare in 2025), then, of course, it will be necessary to scrape their website, but this must be done extremely carefully to avoid impacting their website's performance and being banned from their website (point 4).
7) In the case of point 6, I can implement the scraping functionality as a Magento module.
The key advantage of making it a Magento module is that the scraping's settings can be conveniently placed in the Magento's backend interface, where you can manage its configuration and control the scraping process.
This module effectively makes the scenario of point 6 equivalent to the scenario of point 5: by carefully scraping the supplier's website and creating a structured data file.
8) Once a structured data file is obtained, both scenarios converge on the same task: importing this file into your store.
Several options are available for this task.
The best option will depend on the data structure of your supplier's products.
8.1) Option 1: Installing a ready-made module for importing structured data into Magento (e.g., FireBear Studio Improved Import & Export, Amasty Import).
This option is suitable if your supplier's data structure is supported by such a module.
8.2) Option 2: Developing a custom import module to import the structured data into your store.
This ensures it will support the exact data format your project needs.
