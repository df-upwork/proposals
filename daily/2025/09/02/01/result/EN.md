1) The correct solution to your problem in 2025 is to rent a dedicated server and to configure it correctly for Magento.
Your bots are primarily of 2 types:
2.1) Competitor monitoring bots (price analyzers)
In 2025, there are dozens of services in the world that allow e-commerce websites to monitor competitors' prices in real time and then automatically adapt prices in their own stores in accordance with a predefined market strategy.
2.2) AI bots.
AI is currently experiencing another dot-com boom, and there are hundreds of AI startups, fueled by venture capital and parsing the entire Internet multiple times a day.
3) Combating both types of bots in 2025 is futile.
With each passing year, you will encounter bots instead of people more and more often: from a taxi driver to the technical support for the very medical equipment that you sell.
It is simply a new reality that you have to learn to live with.
Selling medical equipment in the USA — you can surely afford a proper server and its professional configuration.
