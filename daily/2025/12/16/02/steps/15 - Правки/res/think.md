## 5.2.2.

`MHᨀ` owns 100% of `MTᨀ` shares.

## 5.2.3.

`MTᨀ` incorporates a `U᛭` C-Corporation (`U2ᨀ`) to acquire business assets from `Uᨀ` at fair market value.
This transaction establishes a stepped-up basis but triggers immediate tax for `Uᨀ` on the sale of inventory located in `U᛭`.
Dividends distributed by `U2ᨀ` to `MTᨀ` will be subject to a 15% `FWT` under the Derivative Benefits clause of the `U᛭`-`M᛭` Treaty.

## 5.2.4.

Profit flows from `U2ᨀ` to `MTᨀ` as dividends which are exempt from corporate tax in `M᛭` under the Participation Exemption.
Subsequently, `MHᨀ` distributes dividends to `CHᨀ` without `FWT` in `M᛭`.

## 5.4.1.

The Branch structure would likely trigger a 15% Branch Profits Tax because as an individual resident of Italy you qualify only for the 15% dividend rate under the `U᛭`-Italy Treaty.
This results in an effective tax burden comparable to the `U2ᨀ` structure (~32.85%).
However, the `U2ᨀ` structure is preferable as it offers superior legal certainty and simplified banking compliance.
