## Title
UPS and Fedex Tracking API

## Description
We are seeking an experienced API developer or data integration specialist to assist in tracking approximately 100,000 UPS and FedEx shipments.  
The tracking numbers are provided in a spreadsheet, and your task will be to use the respective APIs to retrieve and record tracking events for each shipment.
Please see sample file below.  
Green cells are existing and yellow is what needs to be pulled from the API and appended to the spreadsheet.
Needs to be done ASAP.  
Please respond only if you can start working on this right away.
We will continue on this project but for now need this done as quickly as possible!  
Thank you!
