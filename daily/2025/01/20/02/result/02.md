1) Eliminating the cause of the «skimming attack» will take about 30 working hours.
2) Right now your store is running on a sub-version of Magento 2.4: https://shop.felixprinters.com/magento_version
There are significant differences between these sub-versions, because the initial release, `2.4.0`, came out 4.5 years ago on 2020-07-28: https://github.com/magento/magento2/releases/tag/2.4.0
And the latest one, `2.4.7-p3`, was released 3 months ago, on 2024-10-08: https://github.com/magento/magento2/releases/tag/2.4.7-p3
Thus, there is a span of more than 4 years of development among the sub-versions of Magento 2.4, and the amount of effort required to bring your store up to the latest release (`2.4.7-p3`) depends on your current sub-version.
Approximately, upgrading your store to the `2.4.7-p3` version will take about 70 working hours.
