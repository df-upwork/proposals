I have repeatedly handled notarial and other legal procedures in Istanbul for my own purposes.
I have documented a part (5%) of my experience on my website:
- notarial acts: https://df.tips/tag/turkey-notary?order=views
- Turkish legislation in general: https://df.tips/tag/turkish-law
This is only a small part of the legal tasks that I have resolved in Turkey.
As I am a foreigner (I have a residence permit in Turkey), I have also handled apostille matters repeatedly.
Moreover, I have experience with non-standard solutions for complex legal issues.
In particular, I have personally developed a working method for converting screenshots of interfaces from foreign information systems into notarized documents in Turkey, even without translating them into the Turkish language, and then, after having them apostilled, converting them into internationally valid documents.
I also know how certain notarial acts can be performed in Turkey completely or partially remotely.
For this purpose, Turkey has a semi-defunct and neglected E-Tespit system: https://portal.tnb.org.tr/Sayfalar/TespitHiz.aspx
For an ordinary person, it is practically impossible to get it to work: this system for recording notarial acts uses a virtual machine which crashes with errors at every stage.
But I, as a programmer, managed to overcome all its problems and subsequently obtain real notarial documents.
