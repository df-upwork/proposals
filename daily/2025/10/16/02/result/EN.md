Your misconceptions:
1) «Help us navigate Epic’s support structure to find the right contacts or departments who can implement the necessary changes»
You mistakenly believe that Epic Corporation (the software vendor) is responsible for the operational configuration of its clients' systems and can implement the changes required to add the clinic as a referral destination.
The configuration and customization of Epic are carried out by the IT teams of your potential partner healthcare organizations, not by the vendor.
Integration requires working directly with the IT teams and relevant administrative staff (e.g., Physician Liaisons) of these organizations.
Epic Corporation provides the platform and standards, but customers control how and with whom they connect.
2) «help our external clinic become a recognized referral destination within Epic»
You mistakenly perceive «Epic» as a single centralized platform or a global network.
This leads to the assumption that a one-time integration is sufficient to become universally recognized.
Epic uses a federated model: every customer runs their own independent Epic instance and controls their own configuration and data exchange.
There is no central Epic endpoint. 
To receive electronic referrals from organizations using Epic, you will need to establish connections directly with individual organizations.
You are mistakenly looking for a single technical solution, whereas multiple independent integration efforts with each partner are required.
3) «configuring our setup so that providers can easily refer patients to us»
You overestimate the significance and scope of configuration on your side, while underestimating the critical dependence on the configurations managed by the IT teams of the target organizations.
The key element for the clinic to appear in the physician's workflow is the configuration of the SER (Service Provider) Master File in each target organization.
External providers must be explicitly added to this file with their status specified.
This file is managed exclusively by the owner of the Epic installation.
You do not have access to this configuration.
While some configuration on your side is necessary (e.g., for managing access via EpicCare Link, a common referral portal), this is secondary.
Your misconception lies in overlooking that the primary and most critical configuration (the addition to the SER file) is entirely beyond your control.
