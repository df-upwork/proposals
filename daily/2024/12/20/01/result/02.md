2.1) The U.S. residential kitchen market is currently in a deep crisis  due to 2 major factors:
2.1.1) The general state of the U.S. economy. 
For example, a decline in real estate sales naturally leads to a decline in kitchen sales — this is an obvious factor, but not the main one.  
2.1.2) The main factor: The residential kitchen market is at a late stage of its life cycle (in decline) due to the shift of home cooking from a necessity to more of a hobby. 
New generations increasingly prefer 
*) food delivery
*) eating out
*) buying ready meals and semi-finished products in supermarkets. 
It is a strategic factor.
2.2) According to Google Trends, interest in kitchens in the U.S. has been declining for 4 years, and last year it fell to the level of 2017: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F025s6gm
2.3) I know how to address these challenges in the current crisis situation.
3) In total, I have completed 532 Magento projects on Upwork.
