# 1. «Add and update products in Magento, including descriptions, prices, attributes, and categories»
## 1.1. Managing attributes in Magento
### 1.1.1. Data Extraction
LLMs excel at extracting structured data from unstructured sources:
- From text: analysis of documents, webpages, or supplier emails to extract the necessary attributes and their values.
- From images/diagrams: multimodal models can extract technical data from images of specifications or diagrams.
### 1.1.2. Normalization and standardization
LLMs can bring attribute values to a single standard adopted in the store.
e.g., unification of units of measurement (converting pounds to kilograms) or standardization of notation formats (e.g., 220V instead of 220 Volt).
## 1.2. Managing categories in Magento
Based on analyzing the product title, description, and attributes, an LLM can predict with high accuracy the most suitable category and subcategories in the Magento taxonomy.
This eliminates the need to manually select the category tree for each new product.
## 1.3. Managing prices in Magento
An LLM can analyze supplier price lists in various formats (CSV, PDF, text), extract prices, perform basic calculations (e.g., currency conversion), and match them with products in the database in preparation for import.
## 1.4. Managing product descriptions in Magento
### 1.4.1. Creating descriptions from raw data
LLMs can generate coherent, marketing-oriented, and unique descriptions based on basic characteristics, manufacturer specifications (PDFs, documents), or notes.
### 1.4.2. Style adaptation
LLMs can be tuned to generate text in accordance with your brand's tone (Robots International) — e.g., a professional and technological style.
### 1.4.3. Multimodal processing
LLMs can analyze product images and use the visual information to enrich the description or verify its characteristics.
# 2. «Copy product content (text, specs, features) from other platforms or documents»
## 2.1. Guaranteed structured output
The key mechanism for automating this task is the ability of an LLM to reliably generate output in a strictly defined format (e.g., JSON).
This is achieved using «Function Calling» / «Tool Use» techniques or specialized structured output modes supported by the APIs of all leading LLMs.
Technically, this is often implemented via Constrained Decoding.
This method intervenes directly in the token generation process, masking (excluding) any tokens that would violate the predefined schema (e.g., JSON Schema).
This ensures 100% compliance of the output with the target structure, turning the LLM into a reliable data parser and eliminating the need for external format validation.
## 2.2. Document processing
Leading LLMs are multimodal (Vision-Language Models, VLM), which enables the automation of data extraction from complex documents (PDFs, catalogs, specification images).
### 2.2.1. Native PDF and image processing
LLMs use computer vision capabilities to directly process visual formats.
They analyze the document layout, recognizing tables, diagrams, and text in the context of their visual arrangement.
### 2.2.2. Extraction from complex layouts
Advanced approaches, such as «Agentic Document Extraction», use visual grounding — the association of extracted data with its coordinates in the document — to enhance accuracy and verifiability.
## 2.3. Extraction from web platforms: Semantic scraping
When copying from websites, LLMs enable the shift from traditional scraping, based on fragile selectors (XPath/CSS), to semantic scraping.
LLMs identify information based on its meaning and context (e.g., «product price», «list of features»), rather than its location in the DOM structure.
This ensures robustness against changes in the website layout.
# 3. «Edit and upload product images, ensuring proper sizing and optimization»
## 3.1. Intelligent Image Editing
### 3.1.1. Smart Cropping and Segmentation
Using computer vision capabilities, LLMs identify the main product (Salient Object Detection).
This allows for automatically segmenting the image to remove the background or cropping it to keep the product in focus when adapting to different aspect ratios.
### 3.1.2. Instruction-Based Editing
LLMs can translate high-level requests (e.g., «Make the background pure white», «Increase the product's contrast») into precise parameters for editing models.
## 3.2. Visual Quality Assessment
### 3.2.1. Image Quality Assessment
LLMs can be used to assess visual quality, detecting compression artifacts or incorrect processing.
### 3.2.2. Compliance Verification
Using Visual Question Answering capabilities, an LLM verifies compliance with the store's standards (e.g., «Is the background uniformly white?», «Is the product centered?»).
# 4. «Save and organize product data and descriptions for internal use»
## 4.1. Intelligent data structuring and extraction
LLMs automate the conversion of unstructured or semi-structured data (documents, emails, supplier specifications) into formats suitable for storage in internal systems (PIM, databases).
LLMs are capable of generating data strictly in accordance with a predefined schema: I have already described the methods for achieving this in point 2.1 above.
## 4.2. Data normalization and harmonization
### 4.2.1. Semantic Normalization
Unlike rule-based approaches (e.g., regular expressions), LLMs use contextual understanding to identify and resolve inconsistencies.
They can autonomously standardize formats (e.g., addresses, phone numbers), unify terminology, and fill in missing values.
### 4.2.2. Schema Harmonization
When aggregating data from heterogeneous sources, LLMs are capable of recognizing semantic relationships between fields with different structures.
They can determine the equivalence of attributes (e.g., «Part Number» in one document and «SKU» in another) without explicit mapping rules, which automates data unification.
### 4.2.3. Entity Resolution
LLMs are used to identify and merge duplicate records of products or components, even if their names or identifiers differ.
The model analyzes the semantic similarity of the entities' properties to determine their identity.
## 4.3. Semantic organization and knowledge management
### 4.3.1. Vector databases and RAG
Organized data (structured attributes and unstructured descriptions) are converted into vector representations (embeddings), which capture their semantic meaning.
These vectors are stored in a specialized Vector Database.
Internal users can query information in natural language.
The system performs a search based on the semantic similarity of vectors, rather than by keywords.
The found relevant data is extracted and passed to the LLM as context to generate an accurate answer.
This transforms the internal storage into an intelligent knowledge system.
### 4.3.2. Building Knowledge Graphs
A knowledge graph captures explicit relationships between data points, providing a deeper context than traditional databases.
Using knowledge graphs in RAG (GraphRAG) improves context retrieval by leveraging explicit relationships between entities.
This enables multi-step reasoning and providing more comprehensive answers to complex internal queries about products.
# 5. «Duplicate existing products and modify content as needed»
## 5.1. Text transformation and generation
Models repurpose the content of the source product to align with new attributes (color, size) or requirements (a new market, audience).
### 5.1.1. Adaptive generation
LLMs generate descriptions based on modified technical parameters.
The process includes dynamically passing the attributes of the new variant to the prompt.
### 5.1.2. Rewriting and stylization
LLMs change the tone and emphasis.
Effective implementation requires structured input: brand guidelines, product details, and formatting instructions.
## 5.2. Modification of structured data
Modern LLMs support tool calling (I have already described it in point 2.1 above).
This allows them to convert natural language instructions (e.g., «Change the material to titanium and update the warranty») into structured data (JSON).
This is used to generate the precise parameters required to update product attributes via the Magento API.
## 5.3. Multimodal processing
Multimodal LLMs can analyze images of new product variants.
They are capable of extracting visual characteristics (color, design) and automatically updating the corresponding text descriptions and attributes in the product card.
# 6. «Maintain consistent formatting and accuracy across listings»
## 6.1. In-Context Learning (ICL) for applying guidelines
The primary mechanism for style adaptation is In-Context Learning, specifically, Few-Shot Prompting.
Models do not require fine-tuning to adhere to specific formatting requirements; instead, they learn on the fly through demonstration examples («exemplars») included in the prompt.
Providing the LLM with reference listings or «source data» → «standardized listing» pairs allows the model to recognize and reproduce the required patterns (Brand Guidelines), ensuring consistency at scale.
## 6.2. Attribute normalization (PAVE)
LLMs effectively convert heterogeneous data into the standardized format required by Magento.
This includes:
### 6.2.1. String Wrangling
Text cleaning, HTML correction, capitalization standardization
### 6.2.2. Name Expansion/Generalization
Unifying synonyms and abbreviations.
### 6.2.3. Unit Conversion
Automatic conversion of units to a single system (I have already provided examples in point 1.1.2 above).
## 6.3. Ensuring factual accuracy and data validation
### 6.3.1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The key architecture for ensuring accuracy is RAG (I have already mentioned it in point 4.3.1 above).
RAG allows to «ground» the model on your company's authoritative data sources (manufacturer specifications, PIM databases).
The RAG system extracts up-to-date information from the vector knowledge base and provides it to the LLM as context.
### 6.3.2. Semantic validation and LLM-as-a-Judge
LLMs can assess the semantic consistency of a listing, detecting logical contradictions between the description, specifications, and images.
The LLM-as-a-Judge approach is often used, where a high-performance model is instructed to assess content against specified criteria for quality, accuracy, and adherence to guidelines.
# 7. «Spot and correct errors or inconsistencies in product data»
## 7.1. Structured data validation and anomaly detection
For analyzing product attributes in Magento (prices, categories, specifications), LLMs are used to identify structural violations, statistical deviations, and contextual errors.
LLMs identify errors that are syntactically correct but semantically incorrect in the context of similar products (e.g., implausible dimensions or weight for a specific category of robotics).
## 7.2. Semantic and factual verification
### 7.2.1. Contradiction Detection
LLMs analyze the semantic consistency between the various fields of the product card (title, description, technical specifications).
The model is capable of identifying logical conflicts, e.g., if the stated functions in the description contradict the data in the specifications table.
### 7.2.2. Verification using RAG
To verify the accuracy of technical data (which is critically important for robotics — your company's market niche), RAG is used (I have already mentioned it in points 4.3.1 and 6.3.1 above).
LLMs automatically cross-reference information in Magento with authoritative sources — internal documentation, manufacturer specifications, or industry databases.
This ensures the factual accuracy and currency of the content, reducing the risk of hallucinations.
## 7.3. Multimodal verification
Modern leading LLMs are multimodal: they are capable of processing and correlating visual and textual information, automating the verification that images correspond to the content.
### 7.3.1. Cross-Modal Consistency
LLMs simultaneously analyze the product image and its textual attributes.
They identify inconsistencies in color, model, configuration, or visible characteristics.
### 7.3.2. Visual Attribute Extraction
Models can extract information directly from images, even if it is absent in the text.
e.g., Shopify uses MLLM to automatically extract and classify product attributes in its global catalog, analyzing both text and images for a comprehensive understanding of the product.
# 8. «Follow up on pending tasks and ensure deadlines are met»
## 8.1. Autonomous identification and interpretation of tasks
LLMs minimize dependence on manual data entry, autonomously identifying pending tasks directly from workflows and unstructured data (email, chats, Magento/CRM system logs).
### 8.1.1. Intelligent Extraction
Using advanced Natural Language Understanding, models identify intents (Intent Recognition) and extract key entities (Entity Extraction), such as deadlines, responsible parties, and task specifications, even if they are not formalized in a task tracker.
### 8.1.2. Contextual synthesis
Leveraging their long-context processing capabilities, LLMs synthesize information from disparate sources and lengthy communications.
This makes it possible to determine the current status of a task and identify blocking factors without the need for manual status updates.
## 8.2. Predictive management of deadlines and risks
Instead of reactively responding to missed deadlines, LLMs enable proactive risk management using predictive analytics.
By analyzing historical data on the completion of similar tasks (e.g., the average time to add content in Magento) and current metrics (resource load, response speed), LLMs predict the probability of missing deadlines.
## 8.3. Communication automation (Follow-ups)
LLMs take on the routine tasks of requesting status and reminding about deadlines, increasing the efficiency and personalization of communication.
### 8.3.1. Contextual message generation
Upon detecting a task requiring attention, LLMs generate personalized, professional reminders or status requests.
### 8.3.2. Autonomous processing of responses
LLMs are capable of not only initiating follow-ups, but also interpreting incoming responses.
This allows to automatically update the task status in the corresponding system (CRM, Magento), closing the feedback loop without human intervention.
# 9. «Handle basic customer communications and order processing»
## 9.1. Customer communication automation
LLMs transform the processing of incoming communications, ensuring intelligent routing and autonomous request resolution.
### 9.1.1. Intelligent triage and routing
LLMs perform semantic analysis of incoming messages (email, chat) to accurately determine the request's purpose and its context.
#### 9.1.1.1. Intent Recognition
Models classify requests with high accuracy, distinguishing nuances unavailable to traditional methods.
Accurate intent recognition is fundamental to determining which requests can be resolved autonomously and which require escalation.
#### 9.1.1.2. Sentiment and urgency analysis
LLMs assess the emotional tone and urgency, enabling the automatic prioritization of critical inquiries or the detection of dissatisfaction at early stages, routing such cases directly to specialized support teams.
## 9.1.2. Contextual accuracy via RAG
To generate answers for typical queries (order status, product characteristics, return policy), LLMs use the RAG architecture.
This allows the model not to rely on outdated training data, but to extract up-to-date information from corporate systems in real time.
### 9.1.2.1. Hyperpersonalization
RAG systems integrate information from internal knowledge bases and FAQs with specific client data (order history, status), extracted from Magento or a CRM.
This allows to generate hyper-personalized and factually accurate responses.
### 9.1.2.2. Reducing WISMO (Where Is My Order?)
Integration with logistics systems enables an LLM not only to respond to delivery status inquiries, but also to proactively initiate communication with the customer upon detecting anomalies (e.g., delays), thereby reducing the load on support.
## 9.2. Order processing automation
In order processing, LLMs serve as an intelligent core, interpreting unstructured data and orchestrating the execution of operations in backend systems.
### 9.2.1. Intelligent data processing
LLMs are capable of processing unstructured data related to orders, e.g., requests to change an order or address received by email.
Using advanced Named Entity Recognition, models extract critical data (SKU, quantity, addresses, order numbers).
This data is automatically validated, cross-referenced with data in Magento, and converted into a structured format for system updates, minimizing manual entry.
### 9.2.3. Exception handling and validation
LLMs are used for complex order validation and standard exception handling.
This includes the automatic authorization of returns (RMA) in the Magento backend, as well as the analysis of transaction and behavior patterns to identify potentially fraudulent operations.
# 10. «Support general Magento operations and back-end tasks»
I have already described this in point 9 above.
