1) In this situation, it is correct to use «Cost of services plus method» (26 CFR §1.482-9(e): https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.482-9#e).
2) I am sure that many will incorrectly recommend «Services cost method» (26 CFR §1.482-9(b): https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.482-9#b), however this method is also not correct in this situation because it is applicable to «low value-adding» services, while here there is «executive oversight, business setup, financial structuring, and strategy development».
3) In order to apply CUP or TNMM, it is necessary to find an example of similar services rendered by independent providers in comparable conditions.
It is not obvious where such an example might be found in this situation, therefore CUP and TNMM are not recommended in this situation.
In general, CUP and TNMM are very similar in essence: CUP compares prices, and TNMM compares operational profitability.
At the same time, they differ significantly in the approach to data gathering: CUP requires direct price analogies, whereas TNMM requires a company benchmark.
4) For «Cost of services plus method» it is necessary to carefully select and substantiate the «gross services profit markup» on the cost of services provided by the directors.
The essence of the «arm’s length» approach is to keep records as if the directors from the UK were providing services not to the U.S. subsidiary, but to an independent American company.
Therefore, since directors would not work at cost for independent companies, there must be a «gross services profit markup» in the financial calculations.
Big 4 (Ernst & Young, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) have standard rates for managerial and financial consulting.
Their gross profit margin is usually 20–40%.
For intra-group advisory, a slightly lower markup is usually applied.
In this situation, 15% is recommended.
5) The correct «Reduced scope transfer pricing analysis» should look approximately as follows:
5.1) General information:
5.1.1) Parties to the transaction:
- «Printspace Studios Ltd (UK)»: the parent company providing managerial and administrative services.
- «theprintspace inc (US)»: a 100% subsidiary receiving services (incorporated in the United States).
5.1.2) Essence of the services provided:
- Executive oversight
- Business setup
- Financial structuring
- Strategy development
5.1.3) Amount and date of invoice issuance.
5.1.4) Strategic objective:
- Ensure that the given management fee meets the «arm’s length» principle under IRS Section 482 and can be documented in Form 5472, filed together with Form 1120 (the U.S. corporate income tax return).
5.2) Regulatory framework:
- IRS §482
- Treasury Regulations, 26 CFR §1.482-1 and §1.482-9
- OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
5.3) Choice of method: «Cost of services plus method» (point 1).
5.4) Functional analysis:
5.4.1) Functions of the service-providing party (Printspace Studios Ltd)
5.4.2) Functions of the service-receiving party (theprintspace inc)
5.4.3) Conclusion on the functional analysis
5.5) Calculation of the cost base (based on `Management fee recharge.xlsx`)
5.6) Supporting documents.
5.7) Substantiation of the «gross services profit markup».
6) «What would be the estimated cost and timeline for a reduced scope transfer pricing analysis?»
This will take approximately 15-20 working hours.
7) «Would this analysis provide sufficient documentation to support the management fee if reviewed by the IRS?»
Yes.
8) «Are there any best practices or additional steps we should consider?»
8.1) It is necessary to verify that the data from the «Transfer pricing analysis» correspond to the accounting data and the data in Form 1120.
8.2) It is necessary to properly complete Form 5472 by selecting the correct transaction code, indicating the amount including the markup, and avoiding technical errors.
8.3) Neither in the United States nor in the United Kingdom is it required to automatically attach the «Transfer pricing analysis» to the tax return.
Instead, it is necessary for companies to maintain documentation confirming compliance with the «arm’s length» principle and to provide it to tax authorities upon request (for example, during an audit or a request for additional materials).
