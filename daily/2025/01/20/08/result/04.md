1) NetSuite and Adobe Commerce integration  
1.1) For your case, the most appropriate integration method is the REST API from NetSuite («SuiteTalk REST Web Services Platform»): https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_1540391670.html  
1.1.1) This method (unlike prebuilt Adobe Commerce or NetSuite add-ons and integration platforms) covers the requirements you outlined. 
1.1.2) Below, in subsections 1.2-1.10, I review your integration requirements and clarify how to implement them using the method 1.1.  
1.2) General integration architecture:  
1.2.1) I will create a specialized module for Adobe Commerce.  
1.2.2) The module will interact with NetSuite using the method 1.1.
1.3) A common NetSuite configuration:
1.3.1) Create an «Integration Record» for token based authentication: NetSuite will produce «Consumer Key» and «Consumer Secret».
1.3.2) Create a Role tied to that «Integration Record»: NetSuite will produce «Token ID» and «Token Secret».
1.3.3) All 4 keys alongside with «Account ID» (your company's ID in NetSuite) will be supplied to my Adobe Commerce module.
1.4) «Customer Sync: Real-time synchronization of customer data, including new registrations, updates, and deletions, between the website and NetSuite»  
It can be implemented as follows:  
1.4.1) New customer registrations in Adobe Commerce  
1.4.1.1) In Adobe Commerce, there is an event `customer_register_success` that triggers upon successful registration of a new customer.  
1.4.1.2) My module will implement an «observer» that monitors this event.  
1.4.1.3) When the event is triggered, my module will form a JSON with the customer data and then, over the HTTPS protocol, perform a `POST` request to the appropriate SuiteTalk REST API endpoint (`/services/rest/record/v1/customer`), placing the customer data data in the request body.  
1.4.1.4) NetSuite will return the `internalId` of the created record.  
1.4.1.5) My module will keep this `internalId` in Adobe Commerce, so that when updates occur, it is clear which NetSuite record they refer to. 
1.4.2) Updating customer data from Adobe Commerce to NetSuite  
Similarly to points 1.4.1.1-1.4.1.2, my module will monitor the appropriate event and when it is triggered, the module will send a `PATCH` or `PUT` (depending on the NetSuite REST API version) request via HTTPS, transmitting the customer's `internalId` alongside the updated data to NetSuite.  
1.4.3) Updating customer data from NetSuite to Adobe Commerce
In NetSuite, I will program a «SuiteScript» that will sends updates to my Adobe Commerce module’s endpoint as whenever a customer record is updated in NetSuite.
1.5) «Item Sync: Ensures real-time product data synchronization from NetSuite to Adobe Commerce, categorizing items for Sleek and Corp, and handling product updates and deletions»  
Given your requirement for «real-time synchronization», the best strategy is pushing item updates from NetSuite to Adobe Commerce: whenever an «Item» record is created, modified, or removed in NetSuite, a script («SuiteScript») will automatically relay the relevant data to my Adobe Commerce module over REST API.
There are 2 ways to implement such a «SuiteScript»:  
1.5.1) «User Event Script» («After Submit»)  
It will trigger immediately after the «Item» record is saved in NetSuite.  
This method is suitable for single-record or small-scale updates.  
The SuiteScript (JavaScript) code will send updates to my Adobe Commerce module’s endpoint or creating/updating/deactivating the product in Adobe Commerce.  
1.5.2) «Map/Reduce» or «Scheduled Script»  
It runs on a schedule at predefined intervals.  
This method is preferable if items are updated frequently and you wish to avoid frequent real-time calls (method 1.5.1). 
In this method, the script uses a «Saved Search» to retrieve all Items with a  `lastModifiedDate` newer than the previous run, and then sends them to my module in Adobe Commerce for synchronization.  
1.5.3) If there is really a massive amount of changes, a combined approach can be used: the «User Event Script» enqueues data in a custom record or external queue, and then a separate «Map/Reduce» picks it up. 
But in small/medium projects, 1.5.1 or a short-interval «Scheduled Script» (1.5.2) is enough. 
1.6) «Sales Order Sync: Two-way real-time synchronization of sales orders between NetSuite and the website, including status updates, payment mapping, and guest user handling»
1.6.1) Scenario «Adobe Commerce → NetSuite» can be implemented like this:  
1.6.1.1) A customer places an order in Adobe Commerce.  
1.6.1.2) My Adobe Commerce module monitors the order saving event (`sales_order_place_after`, similarly to points 1.4.1.1-1.4.1.2) and then triggers a REST API call to NetSuite (similarly to point 1.4.1.3), creating a «Sales Order» in NetSuite.  
1.6.1.3) NetSuite (similar to point 1.4.1.4) returns the `internalId` (Sales Order ID) in response. 
1.6.1.4) My module will keep this `internalId` in Adobe Commerce (similarly to point 1.4.1.5), so that when updates occur, it is clear which NetSuite record they refer to.
1.6.2) Scenario «NetSuite → Adobe Commerce» can be implemented like this:  
1.6.2.1) A manager in NetSuite updates the Sales Order (changes status, indicates payment, creates partial shipment, etc.).  
1.6.2.2) A «User Event Script» (similar to point 1.5.1) or a «Scheduled Script» (similar to point 1.5.2) in NetSuite tracks these changes and sends them to my Adobe Commerce module through the module's REST endpoint.  
1.6.2.3) My module:  
- updates the order status,  
- adds the shipment tracking number,  
- sets the order to «complete» or «canceled» etc.  
1.7) «Promotions and Tax: NetSuite-managed promotions and tax configurations will be automatically applied to sales orders on the website, with real-time syncing to ensure consistency»  
With my method from point 1.1, it is implemented as follows:  
1.7.1) In NetSuite, a «User Event Script» or «Scheduled Script» will be configured for «Promotion» (record type: `promotionCode`), «SuitePromotions» and tax rules.  
1.7.2) When a promo code is created/modified/deleted, NetSuite will send a request to my module via the module's REST API.  
1.7.3) My module will process the requests from point 1.7.2 and update in Adobe Commerce the tax and discount rules.  
1.7.4) Thus, the customer's cart in Adobe Commerce will correctly reflect the tax and discount rules from NetSuite.  
1.8) «Item Fulfillment and Shipping Method Sync: Fulfillment processes and shipping methods will be managed in NetSuite, with updates reflected in Adobe Commerce»  
1.8.1) Scenario «Item Fulfillment Sync» (NetSuite → Adobe Commerce)  
1.8.1.1) Creating/updating Fulfillment in NetSuite  
A manager in NetSuite, based on a Sales Order, creates an «Item Fulfillment» (record type: `itemFulfillment`).  
1.8.1.2) Synchronization with Adobe Commerce will be carried out similarly to points 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.  
1.8.2) Scenario «Shipping Method Sync» (NetSuite → Adobe Commerce)  
1.8.2.1) In NetSuite, there are «Shipping Items» (record type: `shipItem`).  
1.8.2.2) When adding/modifying/deleting «Shipping Items» in NetSuite, these changes will be synchronized with Adobe Commerce similarly to points 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.  
1.9) «Cash Sale and RMA Sync: One-way synchronization of cash sales and RMAs from NetSuite to Adobe Commerce, ensuring seamless order and return management»  
1.9.1) Cash Sale  
1.9.1.1) A Cash Sale is a transaction in NetSuite where payment occurs immediately, without a separate process of issuing and closing an Invoice.  
1.9.1.2) Once a `cashSale` record has been created or edited in NetSuite, the corresponding updates will be pushed to Adobe Commerce following the procedure in points 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.
1.9.2) RMA (Return Authorization)  
1.9.2.1) An RMA is a document that records the return of goods from a customer.  
Subsequently, «Item Receipt» (receiving goods in the warehouse) and «Credit Memo» (monetary refund) can be created in NetSuite.  
1.9.2.2) Similar to point 1.9.1.2, as soon as a record of type `returnAuthorization` appears or is updated in NetSuite, these changes will be synchronized with Adobe Commerce similarly to points 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.  
1.10) «A custom record will store synchronization failures, with retries scheduled every 15 minutes. Persistent issues will trigger email notifications to the administrator.»  
With my method from point 1.1, it is implemented as follows:  
1.10.1) For every «event» (for example, creating/editing Sales Order, Item, Fulfillment, etc.), the «User Event Script» (an example was described above in point 1.5.1) or the Scheduled Script (an example was described above in point 1.5.2) will attempt to send data to my Adobe Commerce module via REST.  
1.10.2) If my module (or a higher-level system: Adobe Commerce or server software) could not process the request from NetSuite, then NetSuite will record a failure report in a special place (database table) and retry later.  
1.10.2.1) The table in NetSuite will have the following fields:  
- «Record Type» (which object we tried to synchronize: Order, Item, Customer)  
- «Record ID» (which specific identifier in NetSuite)  
- «Action» (Create, Update, Delete in Magento)  
- «Error Message» (error text, code, Magento response body)  
- «Number of Retries» (how many times we have tried already)  
- «Last Attempt Date» (the date/time of the last attempt)  
- «Next Attempt Date» (when we plan to try again)  
- «Status» (Pending, In Progress, Failed, Resolved, etc.)  
1.10.3) On a schedule (every 15 minutes), NetSuite will run a «Scheduled Script» or «Map/Reduce Script» that, based on the table from point 1.10.2.1, will repeat the requests to Adobe Commerce.  
2) For a retail furniture business in the United States in 2025, using the ready-made Claue theme from Arrow Theme that you mentioned is not the best and is a significantly outdated solution.  
Implementing this solution will surely only lead you to wasting time and money.  
None of your main competitors on the retail online furniture market in the United States uses such primitive solutions anymore.  
And given that after the pandemic, the furniture market in the United States has already been declining for 4 years (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-01-16%202025-01-16&geo=US&q=/m/0c_jw), with the implementation of a primitive solution you will surely not get the result you expect.
