1) Magento offers 3 built-in product relation types similar to what you need: «Cross‐Sells», «Up‐Sells», «Related Products».
2) «Up‐Sells» semantically is the feature you are implementing.
3) However, since you want to implement your own up-sells logic, I do not recommend altering the program code of the built-in «Up‐Sells» type: it will definitely significantly increase the cost of Magento updates.
3) The correct way to solve your task is  to create a separate relation type (similar to the built-in «Up‐Sells»),  and then integrate the necessary features into it.
4) In the admin panel of the parent product, a separate tab will appear where you can designate which products serve as «upgrade» for the parent product.
These «upgrade» products can be set to «Not Visible Individually», so that they do not appear in the search and catalog.
