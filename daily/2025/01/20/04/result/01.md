1) FDA has issued the guidance document «General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices»: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-wellness-policy-low-risk-devices  
2) I can evaluate your product's compliance (and its Amazon listing) with Document 1.  
3) If your product fully aligns with Document 1, I will surely contest the Amazon’s decision.  
4) In my experience, the most common mistake sellers make in such situations is using words in the product description that hint at therapeutic effects (for example, «therapeutic», «heals», «helps with a specific disease», «improves condition in chronic illnesses»).
