1) Every module installed in Magento drags down the Magento's performance simply because the developers of these modules have no drive to minimize your server usage: they only aim to deliver exactly the functionality specified  in their scope.
For example, if you install «Amasty Product Actions», then the main concern of the module's developers is to fulfil their manager’s strict instructions about «product actions» and nothing else, so they do not care about your server performance.
2) I usually solve the problem #1 in the following way:
2.1) I run xDebug Profiler (https://xdebug.org/docs/profile) to reveal the parts of the code that are eating up the server resources
2.2) Then I correct the discovered bottlenecks by refactoring the problem code parts.
3) CCX33 is far from being the best Hetzner choice, because it runs in a cloud-based virtual machine that limits its performance: https://pcr.cloud-mercato.com/providers/hetzner/flavors/ccx33
I have been using Hetzner servers for Magento for 15 years already, and I always prefer their dedicated servers (https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver): they are much faster.
