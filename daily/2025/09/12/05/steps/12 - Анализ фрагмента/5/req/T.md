### 3.2.2. List of documents
Based on point 3.2.1, the following are required:
#### 3.2.2.1. Request Application for a Temporary Assignment Abroad (Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi)
This is a standard application form, defined in **Annex 1 (EK-1)** to `G`.  
It must be completed and signed by the employer (or by an agent on the basis of a power of attorney).
It contains detailed data on the employer, the employee, and the assignment.
#### 3.2.2.2. Letter of assignment (Görev yazısı)
This is an official letter from the Turkish employer confirming the fact of the assignment.  
It must include the purpose and the intended duration of the assignment.
#### 3.2.2.3. Document describing the terms of work in the United Kingdom (interpretation of the requirement «Birleşik Krallıktaki işveren ile yapılmış olan iş sözleşmesi»)
A literal reading of Circular `G` requires the submission of «the employment contract concluded with the employer in the United Kingdom».    
This requirement **contradicts the fundamental principle** of **Article 4(2)** of `C`, according to which, **to maintain Turkish social security coverage, the employee must remain in the service of the sending (Turkish) employer**.    
Concluding a direct employment contract with a British company, as a rule, means coming under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and the obligation to pay British National Insurance contributions (NIC), which nullifies the purpose of obtaining the TUR 1A certificate.    
Consequently, this requirement must be interpreted functionally: as the need for documentary confirmation of the assignment conditions and the interaction with the host party, but not as a replacement for the main Turkish employment contract.  
In practice, such documents include:
#### 3.2.2.3.1. An Assignment Agreement or a Secondment Agreement
It must confirm the continuation of the Turkish employment relationship and define the terms of the temporary work in the United Kingdom.
#### 3.2.2.3.2. A Service Agreement between the Turkish employer and the UK company
It can serve to confirm the purpose and scope of the assignment if the employee is sent to fulfil this agreement.  
It is critically important that the document provided cannot be interpreted by the SGK as a local UK employment contract.
#### 3.2.2.4. Information on the workplace in the United Kingdom
- Name of the workplace (İşyeri adı).  
- Address of the workplace (Adres bilgileri).
