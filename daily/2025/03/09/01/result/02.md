The solution:
1) Use WHOIS to verify that the current domain registrar is indeed GoDaddy.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS  
2) Use WHOIS to find the contact details of the current domain owner (if available).
3) GoDaddy on a domain registration sends 2 emails from `<the address is moderated by Upwork>`:
3.1) Subject: «<Your first name>, your order confirmation is inside».
See an example of this email for my own domain `df.tips` on the attached screenshots `1.1.png` and `1.2.png`.
3.2) Subject: «Congrats, <Your first name>, your domain's ready».
See an example of this email for my own domain `df.tips` on the attached screenshot `2.png`.
4) Find the emails from point 3 and check the `To` field.
This will be the email of the GoDaddy account you need.
5) Use WHOIS to find the domain's registration date (if available).
6) Based on point 5 and the dates of the emails from point 3, find the bank transaction confirming the payment to GoDaddy for the domain registration.
7) Based on points 3 and 6, prove ownership of the domain to GoDaddy support.
