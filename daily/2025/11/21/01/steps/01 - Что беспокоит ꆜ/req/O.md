Disk Issue in VMWare Cluster v7.0.3

## 2.3. Description
`PD` ≔ 
```text
I have a 4 host cluster and the disks in 1 of the hosts are not normal. 
I've attached a screenshot for reference.  
I migrated all vm's using that host #4 for compute to another host and rebooted host #4 but problem remains.  
Looking for someone to explain this issue and what it will take to remedy it. 
I'd also like to install the latest patches to the system.

Finishing Proxmox configuration / VMWare Import

### 6.1.3. Description
`P1D` ≔ 
```text
I had a person install Proxmox on three (3) new HP Servers.  We got the initial installation done ok but never fully finished the configuration.  Each of the servers have 2 x 480Gb sata drives configured for Radi-1 on the server itself and I believe that is where the Proxmox OS was installed on each server.  Each Server also had 2 x 3.84TB NVME drives and I want to build one array using all 6 drives (2 drive from each server) for use to host the VM's that need to be migrated from the VMWare Server.  I want Proxmox configured for High Availability as much as it's capable of so that if a Server fails the VM will autostart on another server or whatever to make it as resilient as possible.  I also need help in making sure imported VM's work properly and are assigned the right disk / storage controller and will start properly.;

Setup VMWare Network

### 6.2.3. Description
`P2D` ≔ 
```text
I have a client remotely located that currently is running VMWare on 2 servers and hosting aprox 7 VM's.  This network is aging and I want to replace it entirely.

I want to install a very redundant configuration, 3-4 servers, 5-10Tb VSAN using drives installed in each server to create VSAN unless their is better option for higher perfomance and redunancy.  I don't have unlimited budget and planning to buy Dell PowerEdge R740 servers with PM1633 SSD's or equivalent unless you have better suggestions.

I'm looking for someone to install the VMWare and configure the entire stack of server for redunancy in case of server / drive failures.

I want someone that can help me spec out the most cost efficient solution and help me get it configured and provide ongoing support as needed.  I need to know what VMWare licenses will be required as well.  I need a competent & reliable person to assist with this project long term.

I have a VMWare VSphere Cluster that someone helped me setup a long time ago.  I currently have 15 or 20 vm's running.  I need to deploy a couple more Windows Servers and I'd like to Download the ISO's and store them and then create a few templates with defaults to make deploying new vm's easier.

Import locally hosted UISP 3.0147 backup/configuration to a cloud hosted UISP 3.0147 version

### 6.4.3. Description
`P4D` ≔ 
```text
I have a cloud hosted version of UISP 3.0147 that's empty and a locally hosted version with docker of UISP 3.0147 and I need to move to the cloud to be able to use Ubiquiti's Payment Gateway.

I've backed up the locally hosted version (2.6Gb) and restored it to the cloud  multiple times and it seems to import to the cloud and reboot everything but when it'd done there is no data in the cloud, no devices, no crm clients / customers, nothing.  Not sure if the import has to be done differently because locally it's running in Docker?  I don't know but I need to get all info in the cloud so the billing can go through the Ubiquiti Payment Gateway.

Looking for an expert with UISP, all aspects of UISP especially managing imports / exports and the database.
