Magento 1.9.4.0 was released 6.5 years ago (2018-12-03) as one of the last patches for Magento 1, which had become obsolete 3 years prior (in 2015).
Magento 2 was released almost 10 years ago: in the autumn of 2015, and since then, Magento developers have been focusing mainly on Magento 2, and not Magento 1.
New versions of Magento 2 are released regularly: for example, the most recent version 2.4.8-p1 was released less than a month ago, on June 10: https://github.com/magento/magento2/releases/tag/2.4.8-p1
Why not upgrade your website from Magento 1.9.4.0 to Magento 2 instead of Shopify?
This appears to be a very reasonable solution, and your current software modules (including the integration with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009) can be ported with high quality from Magento 1 to Magento 2 with full preservation of their current functionality.
