# 3. «A comprehensive list of all required documents and information»
## 3.1. Prerequisites and supporting documents
### 3.1.1. Employee's Citizenship
#### 3.1.1.1. Requirement
The employee must be a **citizen** of **Turkey** or the **United Kingdom**.  
**Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1** of the `Circular` states:  
«Akit taraflardan birinde çalışan bir sigortalının geçici görevlendirme kapsamında diğer akit taraf ülkesine gönderilebilmesi için Türkiye Cumhuriyeti veya Birleşik Krallık vatandaşı olması zorunludur.»  
«For an insured person working in one of the contracting parties to be sent to the country of the other contracting party under a temporary assignment, they must be a citizen of the Republic of Turkey or the United Kingdom.»
### 3.1.1.2. Required document
The employee's identity card (Kimlik) or passport, confirming their citizenship of Turkey or the United Kingdom is required.
## 3.2. Documents and information for the application for a Certificate of Coverage
### 3.2.1. Requirement
**Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1** of the `Circular` states:  
«Geçici görevlendirme talebi yapılırken sigortalı ya da işveren tarafından doldurulacak olan ve EK-1'de yer alan "Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi" ve ekinde görev yazısı ile birlikte Birleşik Krallıktaki işveren ile yapılmış olan iş sözleşmesinin, Birleşik Krallıkta çalışacağı işyeri adı ve adres bilgilerinin Kuruma ibraz edilmesi gerekmektedir.»  
«When requesting a temporary assignment, it is necessary to submit to the Institution [SGK] the «Request Application for a Temporary Assignment Abroad» (Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi), which is contained in Annex-1 (EK-1) and must be completed by the insured person or the employer, together with the accompanying letter of assignment (görev yazısı), as well as the employment contract concluded with the host entity in the United Kingdom, and information on the name and address of the host entity where the employee will be working in the United Kingdom.»
### 3.2.2. List of documents
Based on point 3.2.1, the following are required:
#### 3.2.2.1. Application for a Temporary Assignment Abroad (Yurt Dışı Geçici Görev Talep Dilekçesi)
This is a standard application form, provided in **Annex 1 (EK-1)** to the `Circular`.  
It must be completed and signed by the employer (or by an agent under a power of attorney).
It contains details on the employer, the employee, and the assignment.
#### 3.2.2.2. Letter of assignment (Görev yazısı)
This is an official letter from the Turkish employer confirming the assignment.  
It must include the purpose and the intended duration of the assignment.
#### 3.2.2.3. Document describing the terms of work in the United Kingdom 
It is the interpretation of the requirement «Birleşik Krallıktaki işveren ile yapılmış olan iş sözleşmesi».  
The `Circular`, if read literally, requires the submission of «the employment contract concluded with the host entity in the United Kingdom».    
This requirement **contradicts the fundamental principle** of **Article 4(2)** of the `Convention`, according to which **the employee must remain in the service of the sending (Turkish) employer to maintain Turkish social security coverage**.    
Concluding a direct employment contract with a British company generally means cbecoming subject to the social security legislation of the United Kingdom and incurring the obligation to pay British National Insurance contributions (NIC), which defeats the purpose of obtaining the TUR 1A certificate.    
Consequently, this requirement must be interpreted functionally: as the need for documentary confirmation of the assignment conditions and the interaction with the host party, but not as a replacement for the main Turkish employment contract.  
In practice, such documents include:
- **An Assignment Agreement or a Secondment Agreement**: it confirms the continuation of the Turkish employment relationship and define the terms of the temporary work in the United Kingdom.
- **A Service Agreement between the Turkish employer and the United Kingdom company**: it confirms the purpose and scope of the assignment if the employee is sent to fulfil this agreement.
  
It is critically important that the document provided cannot be interpreted by the SGK as a local United Kingdom employment contract.
#### 3.2.2.4. Information on the host entity in the United Kingdom
- Name (İşyeri adı).  
- Address (Adres bilgileri).
## 3.3. Documents confirming the agent's authority
Since you intend to submit applications on behalf of Turkish employers, you must be officially authorised to represent them before the SGK.  
This requirement stems from general norms of Turkish administrative law and the standard practice for interaction with government bodies.
### 3.3.1. Power of Attorney (Vekaletname)
This is an official document authorising you to file applications for a Certificate of Coverage and to liaise with the SGK on behalf of a Turkish employer.  
- It must be notarized by a Turkish notary.  
- It must explicitly include the authority to liaise with the SGK (SGK nezdinde işlem yapma yetkisi), particularly concerning international social security agreements.
