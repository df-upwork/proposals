The correct way to dissolve your C-corp:
1) Review the corporation's bylaws and any shareholder agreements to determine the dissolution procedure in accordance with the internal corporate documents and the laws of the State of Delaware.
2) Ensure that shareholder and/or board resolutions (depending on the governance structure) are properly prepared and that a supermajority (or other required number of votes) is obtained to initiate the process.
3) Prepare the appropriate corporate dissolution resolution (e.g., «Plan of Dissolution»).
4) Include in the resolution the name of the authorized person who will deal with the authorities and prepare the necessary documents.
5) Obtain shareholder approval (or other form of approval) if required by the corporate documents.
6) Pay the filing fee.
As of today, the standard filing fee is $204, and the reduced fee is $10 (if the corporation has no assets and has already ceased doing business).
7) Pay any outstanding franchise tax obligations.
8) File the Certificate of Dissolution with the Delaware Division of Corporations.
This can be done online at corp.delaware.gov, using the «Document Upload Service» function in the personal account.
9) Compile a list of all known creditors and counterparties.
10) Send official notices of dissolution, stating the deadlines (at least 60 days) and the procedure for filing claims with the corporation.
11)
11.1) In Delaware the «safe harbor» procedure (8 Del. C. §§ 280–281) provides not only for letters to known creditors, but also for the publication of a notice to potential, unknown creditors (if the corporation wishes to obtain maximum protection against late claims).
11.2) For this purpose, notices are placed in a newspaper in order to reach creditors who cannot be identified.
11.3) The newspaper must be published in the same county where the corporation is registered (in Delaware, it is typically New Castle County, Kent County, or Sussex County).
11.4) The newspaper must have «general circulation» — official recognition that it is accessible to the broad public of that county.
11.5) New Castle County often uses The News Journal, for Kent County — Delaware State News, for Sussex County — Cape Gazette.
12) Accepting incoming claims and resolving financial matters: paying debts, entering into forbearance agreements, or preparing other forms of settlement.
13) After all debts have been paid, review the remaining assets of the corporation and complete their distribution to the shareholders.
14) Prepare the relevant documents recording the final balance, and enter a record of the distributed assets into the corporate registers.
15) Close the corporate bank accounts upon completion of all payments to creditors and distribution of assets.
16) Check whether the corporation has any valid licenses, permits or registrations (e.g. in the states where the corporation has been operating) and officially cancel them.
17) Check the corporation's status on the Delaware Division of Corporations website to ensure that the dissolution is reflected in the official record.
18) Ensure that there are no additional tax or administrative obligations: if necessary, file the final tax returns with the IRS and with the relevant state tax authorities.
Often, tax returns (federal and state) are filed in the year of dissolution, and the «final return» may include the «Final return» mark in Form 1120 (for a C-corp).
Failure to file a final return and close the books can sometimes result in additional penalties or «Late filing notices» from the IRS may sometimes occur.
19) Retain copies of all corporate, financial, and legal documents (including the copy of the Certificate of Dissolution) related to the dissolution process, in accordance with document retention laws.
