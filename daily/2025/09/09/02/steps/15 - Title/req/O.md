Create Google Sheet with index match formulas into new files

## 4.1.4. Description
`P1D` ≔ 
```text
I have 5-10 Google Sheets.  I need you to copy a template I have in one Google Sheet, and add it to the 5-10 Google Sheets.  The template will require you to update index match formulas in Google Sheets and make sure the data makes sense.  

If you are interested, I will have a sample for you to review.  We will agree on a fixed number of Google Sheets you cover in one hour per your rate to ensure both sides are happy with the product.  I'd expect this shouldn't take more than 10 minutes for someone who is proficient in Google Sheets or Excel because I have the template already available.

`P2D` ≔ 
```text
I need help validating the address listed on the company's website, and then taking the validated addresses and running the Mail Merge process in a Microsoft Word Document to create the final templates for each letter.

1) Open a Google Sheet with a list of companies.  Go to the URL, find the address, and confirm it matches what is in the Google Sheet for the company's address.
2) Run the automation to check the address is valid
3) Once all addresses are validated, please export the Google Sheet and run the Mail Merge process to create personalized letters for all companies and recipients in the original Google Sheet File.  You will send this file to me as the final deliverable.

Please propose your price per company reviewed (e.g. $0.05 per company validated via their website).  We will agree on this pricing structure.

I need your help to visit the website of a company on my list, submit a contact us form, and complete certain identifying information about the website.

You will visit the website, look for the contact us section, and fill out the form per the information that I provide.
