1) I am currently developing an AI-based legal system, where I have already faced a similar challenge: bridging a general-purpose LLM with essential domain-specific knowledge that the base model does not inherently possess.
2) By December 2024, the recommended solution for your case (customer support) is a combination of 2 technologies:
2.1) RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented-generation
- https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8868588
- https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval#a-primer-on-rag-scaling-to-larger-knowledge-bases
2.2) Function Calling (OpenAI) / Tools (Anthropic):
- https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling
- https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use
- https://github.com/anthropics/courses/blob/master/tool_use/01_tool_use_overview.ipynb#repos-sticky-header
RAG retrieves the relevant data (e.g., B2B contract terms, product specifications, inventory, etc.), while function calls allow the chatbot to operate within the business logic (placing orders, calculating costs, checking discounts, etc.).
The combination of RAG and function calls makes it possible to provide the model with «knowledge» of specific documents (via RAG), and on the other hand, to make precise external API calls (via function calls) for dynamic operations such as checking inventory or placing an order in Magento.
This 2-step approach is currently recommended for building corporate chatbots.
4) How to implement RAG in your case?
4.1) Document your business knowledge in the formats commonly accepted today for LLM: Markdown, XML, PDF, images.
4.2) Convert the data from step 3.1 into embeddings:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding
- https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings
-  https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/embeddings
4.3) Save the embeddings in a vector database: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database
4.4) Retrieval: Given a user query, a document retriever is first called to select the most relevant documents that will be used to augment the query
4.5) Augmentation: The model feeds this relevant retrieved information into the LLM via prompt engineering of the user's original query
4.6) Generation: Finally, the LLM can generate output based on both the query and the retrieved documents
5) How to implement function calling in your case?
5.1) Identify the specific functions (API methods) that the chatbot could call within your Magento environment.
5.2) Instruct the LLM when to call each function.
For example: «If the user wants to place an order, call the `placeOrder` function with these parameters. Do not generate a user-facing response at that step—just generate the JSON function call.»
5.3) When the LLM returns the JSON specifying the function name and arguments (e.g., `placeOrder(userId, productId, quantity)`), your system (usually, a module in Magento) triggers the appropriate Magento functionality, and then sends the response from Magento back to the LLM.
5.4) Finally, the LLM incorporates these results into a user-friendly response (e.g., «Your order ORD-1234 has been successfully placed»).

Вот как один из прошлых подрядчиков описывает бизнес клиента:
<описание подрядчика>
We take great pride of our 100% job success rate, built on years long business relationships with companies from all around the World. We have achieved this by having a great respect for each company and management culture, sharing their goals, adapting to any the environment and put the 100% of our efforts and expertise.

I offer this feedback to those considering a business relationship with them. Throughout our short tenure, we encountered numerous critical issues stemming from poor management, a lack of basic technical and professional knowledge required by the industry, questionable judgment, all of which led to an unproductive and tense working environment. Avoid this company if you don’t want to get entrapped in a toxic relationship.

From the very first day of our collaboration, it became evident that the company had neglected to properly configure essential aspects like SPF and DKIM for their email system. We provided guidance on rectifying these issues, but it was only the tip of the iceberg.

The company operates as a wholesale business but fails to maintain accurate records of orders missing their estimated time of arrival (ETA). Instead, they wait for customers to become angry and inquire about their orders, rather than proactively informing them about any delays.

Another alarming aspect we encountered was their peculiar order status called "pushed," where packed orders languish in the warehouse without being shipped until someone, after the customer complain, takes the initiative to intervene asking to stop ignoring those ready packages.

One of the most disconcerting experience, was of been presented this very singular theory that if the company didn’t have any problem, it would not need a customer service. We were reporting critical issues and plans to resolve or mitigate them, because that were the actions required to make the company’s customers happy, Massaging the communication is a minor part of the work and will work only in the short term. This perspective demonstrated a serious misinterpretation of the importance of customer satisfaction and the role of customer service in any business.

While we could compile a lengthy list of issues, the breach of our fiduciary agreement was particularly revealing. We trusted the company with services from multiple team members, covering various positions, to be billed under a single contract in Upwork with manual time logs. However, without prior notice or explanation, the client paused the contract on a Sunday, preventing us from logging time for the entire past week's work. This move not only undermined our agreement but also displayed a lack of professionalism.

Despite the challenges and toxicity we faced, we remained dedicated to maintaining customer satisfaction. Initially, we found the Customer Satisfaction rate at a mere 57.7%, but through our efforts, it rose to 86% by mid-July. Moreover, out of the few negative feedback received in July, a significant portion was from warehouse job candidates and not from customers, indicating a failure to treat prospective employees with respect and fairness.

While we possess the expertise to navigate such challenging environments, I must emphasize that subjecting oneself to a toxic work environment is not a necessity. We could have achieved our professional goals even in such circumstances, but I would caution others against seeking a partnership with this company. The issues run deep, and their lack of willingness to acknowledge and rectify their shortcomings may hinder progress and growth.

In conclusion, I hope this feedback serves as a candid account of our experience. It is crucial for any business to foster a healthy and productive relationship with its partners and vendors. Unfortunately, the company in question falls short in this regard, and I believe it is in the best interest of all parties involved to explore other opportunities that align better with their values and business goals.

Как ты видишь, в пунктах 2.2, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 своего ответа я привожу некоторые примеры использования «Function Calling».
Однако мне кажется, что эти примеры — слишком абстрактные, не учитывают контекст бизнеса клиента.
Перечисли мне 10 примеров использования «Function Calling» с учётом контекста бизнеса клиента.
