We are seeking an experienced Nutanix Systems Engineer to assist with the deployment of a new 4-node Nutanix cluster, including validation of hardware, software, licensing, and compatibility with an existing production environment.

- Deep understanding of AOS, AHV, Prism Central, and Prism Leap
- Experience with multi-site Nutanix deployments, DR runbooks, and cross-cluster replication
- Ability to validate switch, firewall, and networking requirements for Nutanix clusters
- Knowledge of licensing models (AOS Pro vs Ultimate, Prism Central, Leap, term SKUs, support SKUs)
- Experience guiding customers through new-site buildouts and DR/backup planning

# Key Responsibilities
- Review design, architecture, and BOM for the new 4-node Nutanix site
- Validate all hardware PIDs, NICs, uplinks, switch modules, and licensing against Nutanix compatibility requirements
- Confirm correct AOS Pro and Prism Leap licensing for replication, DR, and recovery workflows
- Ensure all necessary components (hardware, software, support SKUs, cabling, optics, power, etc.) are included and sized correctly
- Validate compatibility between new site and existing production site, including hypervisor, AOS versioning, network topology, and replication capabilities
- Act as a remote technical resource to support planning, documentation, and deployment readiness
- Identify any missing elements or risks in the deployment plan
- Provide best practices around Nutanix cluster setup, networking, node placement, and DR architecture
- Support configuration steps as needed (AHV, Prism, storage containers, networks, protection domains

Cisco DWDM Remote Support – ONS 15454 & NCS 2000 Experience

### 6.2.3. Description
`P2D` ≔ 
```text
We’re looking for a reliable, experienced network engineer or optical transport tech who’s comfortable supporting Cisco DWDM platforms — specifically ONS 15454 (M6/M12 chassis) and/or Cisco NCS 2000.

This is a remote, as-needed role — you’d be helping us troubleshoot or guide us through issues that come up in the field. In some cases, it might just be helping us review CTC logs, verify card configs, or assist with a remote provisioning task. Other times, it could involve guiding an on-site tech who's hands-on with the hardware.

We don’t expect someone to be available 24/7, but we’re building a small bench of go-to experts for optical support. If you’re dependable and know your way around these systems, it could turn into regular work.

Please share any experience you have working with Cisco DWDM platforms such as the ONS 15454 and NCS 2000, as well as any related optical transport hardware or DWDM network architecture.

Oracle DBA - Cleanup High Disk Space - Possibly Extend Disk Space

### 6.3.3. Description
`P3D` ≔ 
```text
We have a Cisco Prime server running on Linux/VMware with Oracle databases experiencing high disk utilization. I need an experienced engineer who can help assess and clean up the environment, and if cleanup is not sufficient, guide us through expanding the underlying storage.

Scope of Work:

Assess current disk usage and identify safe cleanup opportunities in Oracle.

Perform tablespace cleanup, defragmentation, and stats gathering where appropriate.

If cleanup is insufficient, plan and execute storage expansion, which may include:

Adding physical disks and expanding them in Linux

Extending VM storage in VMware and allocating it to the OS

Restart and validate databases once adequate space is available.

Ensure all changes are performed without impacting database integrity.
