There are 4 methods to solve your problem:
1) Automatic generation of `current-sync.json` by the «BrightAuthor:Connected» program.
This is the fastest method but it offers minimal customization options.
It is acceptable if the auto-generated result meets your needs.
2) Writing `current-sync.json` manually (the method you mentioned).
This method is a bit more flexible than 1.
3) I can program the content update logic directly in your `autorun.brs` file (using the BrightScript language).
This is the most flexible method.
4) The paid «BrightSign Network» cloud service.
This is a good method for centralized management of many players, but it is less flexible than 3.
