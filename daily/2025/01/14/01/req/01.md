#### Title
Web Programmer to Investigate and Resolve MySQL injection hack
#### Description
We are looking to work with an expert who can help resolve a hacking issue on our website. Our company is experiencing a repeat issue of being hacked on our sites, typically twice a day. The issue is believed to be a SQL injection, but this is not fully confirmed. Our site is built on static PHP/HTML/CSS/JS, hosted on a cPanel-based server. Every time it is hacked, a wordpress site has been injected into the file directory. The source of the breach is unknown due to the access logs and any form of trace being deleted. In it's current state, we are able to reboot the site using clean files from backup to resolve the issue, but it reappears often. We are looking for a cybersecurity or related expert in wordpress/PHP site breaches to identify the source of the problem, explain the issue, and implement measures and safeguards that prevents it from happening again.
