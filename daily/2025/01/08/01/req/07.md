#### Title
Need Help Resolving Transaction Data Issues in Flask App
#### Description
I am building a Flask application with a focus on managing cryptocurrency transactions. The application includes features like filtering transactions, updating transaction labels, and associating transactions with wallet contacts. However, I am encountering issues with data consistency and session management when fetching and displaying transactions. I need an experienced Python/Flask developer to review my code, identify the root cause of the problem, and implement a robust solution.
Problem Details:
Primary Issue:
Inconsistent transaction data displayed on the transactions page. The page does not always reflect the most recent database changes unless specific actions (e.g., using another function that interacts with the database) are performed.
Suspected Cause: Potential stale ORM instances, improper session handling with SQLAlchemy, or caching issues.
Code Context:
- The app uses SQLAlchemy for database management.
- Transactions are queried and filtered using various parameters such as wallet addresses, transaction types, and asset symbols.
- Pagination is implemented for the transactions page.
- Additional features include setting labels and associating transactions with contacts.
Key Observations:
The data updates correctly when other functions modify the database, suggesting session or ORM instance management issues.
Despite using db.session.remove() and db.session.expire_all() to refresh sessions and ORM instances, the problem persists.
Deliverables:
Diagnose the root cause of the issue and explain why the data inconsistency occurs.
Implement a fix to ensure that the transactions page always reflects the most up-to-date database state.
Review and optimize the SQLAlchemy session handling and query logic to prevent similar issues in the future.
Requirements:
Strong experience with Python and Flask.
Proficiency in SQLAlchemy and database session management.
Familiarity with debugging and resolving ORM caching or data inconsistency issues.
Experience with implementing robust solutions for Flask-based applications.
If you are a Python/Flask specialist with a keen eye for debugging and resolving complex issues, I would love to hear from you!

Я хочу ответить клиенту так:
<ответ>
The most probable reasons (in my experience) why a screen of a Python/Flask application shows outdated data from an SQLAlchemy database:
1) The most popular reason: maybe, objects are requested from the DB and stored somewhere (for example, in a global scope of the the application's memory or in a cache), and then upon subsequent access, the application reads the already existing objects instead of requesting them again from the DB.
2) The second most popular reason — it is the incorrect use of the same session between different HTTP requests.
In most cases, it is best to create a separate session for processing each HTTP request to the Flask application.  
After the work is completed (for example, when it is time to return a response to the client), this session is explicitly committed (commit) or rolled back (rollback), depending on whether the write operations to the database were successful, and then closed and «cleared».
3) From the last sentence of the previous paragraph follows another reason: the changes in the session may be not being committed (no `commit()` or `flush()` is called at the right time).   
4) The reason in using a multithreaded or multiprocess environment: a wrong configuration of `scoped_session`, where several requests are processed in parallel (for example, in gunicorn/uwsgi), the SQLAlchemy session can be incorrectly «shared» between different threads or processes.

Как ты видишь, в пункте 1 клиент пишет: «The page does not always reflect the most recent database changes unless specific actions (e.g., using another function that interacts with the database) are performed.»
Почему «using another function that interacts with the database» устраняет проблему клиента?
Как этот феномен соотносится с моим ответом?
