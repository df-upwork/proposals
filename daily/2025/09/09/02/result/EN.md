1) Hospice Tools LLC (hospicetools.com) is owned by the Klein family: the founder Michael A. Klein and his numerous sons.
He is pictured here with 3 of them: https://voyagechicago.com/interview/meet-michael-klein-chaim-klein-eli-klein-ben-klein-unity-hospice-chicagoland
However, he has more sons, including those involved in the company's management.
2) Michael's e-mail is published in point 1.3 in the attached file `Contract.pdf`.
Upwork prohibits me from writing it directly in the text of the proposal.
3) Almost all of Michael's sons are on LinkedIn, in particular:
Yonah: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonah-klein-cpa-2a09ab170
Eli: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eli-klein-b9599066
Chaim: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaim-klein-0a047311a
Ben: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-klein-6892b061
Some of them are from your small town of Skokie
4) Michael himself is not on social media due to his age.
5) Hospice Tools LLC does not have a «CEO»: the Illinois Limited Liability Company Act does not require an LLC to have a CEO position in its structure.
The legal authority to manage the company and act on its behalf is held by the «Manager» — Michael appointed his son Chaim to this role: see the extract from the State of Illinois register in the attachment (`Hospice Tools LLC.pdf`).
I have provided the link to his LinkedIn above.
6) For operational management, they hired Daniel Goldmeier, assigning him the title «VP Sales and Marketing»: https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goldmeier-0775646
7) 
7.1) Michael owns more than a dozen companies in the hospice industry.
Many of them (including Hospice Tools LLC) are registered in your town of Skokie, and at the same address: 4101 MAIN STREET, SKOKIE, IL 60076-2753.
7.2) Hospice Tools LLC has a second address in addition to its official one, also in your town: 8170 McCormick Blvd Ste 204 Skokie, IL 60076-2914
8) In all of his companies, the official managing authority is held by either he or his sons.
9) His 2 main organizations:
9.1) Unity Hospice Management, Inc.
Extract from the register: `Unity Hospice Management, Inc.pdf`.
9.2) Unity Hospice and Palliative Care Foundation, Inc.
Extract from the register: `Unity Hospice and Palliative Care Foundation, Inc.pdf`
10) In both organizations from point 9, Michael is «President» and «Director», and his son Doniel is «Accounts Payable».
In the second organization, his sons Yonah and Eli are also directors.
11) They created Hospice Tools LLC to spin off the technology product into a separate LLC — this is a classic business decision.
