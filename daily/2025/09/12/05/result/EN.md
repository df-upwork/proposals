1) Legal Framework
Legal relations between the Republic of Turkey and the United Kingdom in the field of social security are governed by the «Convention between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Turkey on social insurance» (hereinafter the `Convention`).  
The `Convention` was signed on 9 September 1959 and entered into force on 1 June 1961.  
In the United Kingdom, it was given effect by «The National Insurance and Industrial Injuries (Turkey) Order, 1961» (S.I. 1961/584): https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1961/584
2) «Identification of the official Turkish authority responsible for handling A1 forms, along with their direct contact details for submission»
2.1) Terminology
2.1.1) The term «A1 form» is incorrect** in this context.  
The «A1 form» is used exclusively to confirm social security coverage for workers moving within the European Economic Area and Switzerland.
2.1.2) For countries with which the United Kingdom has bilateral social security agreements (also called «reciprocal agreements»), such as Turkey, the correct name for the document in the United Kingdom is «Certificate of Coverage» or «Certificate of Continuing Liability».
2.1.3) The Turkish side refers to this document using the special bilateral form «TUR 1A».
2.1.4) The use of correct terminology and, consequently, the correct application forms is a fundamental condition for the successful completion of the procedure*
An attempt to apply the logic or forms associated with the A1 certificate will result in a rejection.
2.2) «Identification of the official Turkish authority»
2.2.1)
According to Articles 1(4) and 1(5) of the `Convention`:
- «Competent authority» for Turkey means «the Ministry of Labour».
- «Social insurance authority» for Turkey means «the Workers' Insurance Institution».
2.2.2)
This distinction is intentional and reflects standard practice in administrative law.   
The «Competent authority» (the Ministry) performs policy-making and regulatory functions, bears overall responsibility for the implementation of the agreement, and acts as the state's representative at the international level.  
At the same time, the «social insurance authority» (the Institution) is the executive, operational body that directly handles administrative functions, such as collecting contributions, processing applications, assigning and paying benefits, as well as issuing supporting documents, such as Certificates of Coverage.  
Since your task is to file applications and obtain a specific document, the point of contact for the applicant is the «social insurance authority», and not the Ministry.
2.2.3)
Since the signing of the `Convention` in 1959, Turkey's social security system has undergone a significant reform.  
The «Workers' Insurance Institution» (Sosyal Sigortalar Kurumu, SSK), mentioned in the text of the `Convention`, was one of the three main social insurance funds.  
In 2006, as part of the reform, these funds were merged into a single entity, the Social Security Institution (Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu, SGK).   
Thus, the SGK is the full legal successor to the «Workers' Insurance Institution» and currently performs the functions of the «social insurance authority» within the meaning of the `Convention`.  
This institution bears the operational responsibility for implementing the provisions of the `Convention`.
2.2.4)
To implement international agreements and to standardize administrative procedures, SGK issues internal regulatory acts, known as circulars («genelge»).  
These documents serve as detailed instructions for regional offices and other interested parties employers, insured persons) on the application of various regulations.  
The key document that directly governs the procedures under the agreement with the United Kingdom is SGK Circular No. 2020/25 (hereinafter the `Circular`) officially titled «Türkiye Cumhuriyeti – Birleşik Krallık Sosyal Güvenlik Sözleşmesi»: https://www.alomaliye.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sgk-genelgesi-2020-25.pdf
2.2.5)
According to Part 2, Section 1, point 1.1.1 of the `Circular`, the initial application for the TUR 1A form is submitted locally to the territorial division of the SGK where the Turkish employer is registered:   
«Başvuruya istinaden TUR 1A formüleri, sigortalının işyerinin kayıtlı olduğu sosyal
güvenlik il müdürlüğü (SGİM) veya sosyal güvenlik merkezi (SGM) tarafından üç nüsha
halinde düzenlenerek iki nüshası Birleşik Krallıktaki yetkili kuruma verilmek üzere sigortalı
ya da işverene verilecek, bir nüshası dosyasında saklanacaktır.»
