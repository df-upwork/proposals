Local representative for Norway

## 6.1.3. Description
`P1D` ≔ 
```text
Who we are: We are a global mobility compliance company based in the UK. We already have a Norwegian NUF and need help agreeing a clear, repeatable approach with NAV for obtaining A1 certificates for employees of our Norwegian corporate clients who work temporarily outside Norway.

What we need:
A practical Norwegian‑speaking coordinator (paralegal/admin/HR/payroll background welcome) to speak with NAV (Medlemskap og avgift) and Altinn support, confirm the exact routes available to an agent (with company POA). This is a short discovery/setup engagement with the option for ongoing support.

Core tasks:
1.Call NAV to confirm when an agent may file A1:
- What’s possible digitally via Altinn (with delegated rights to a named individual)?
- When must we use the postal process?

2. Power of Attorney (POA) requirements (who signs, scope, any Norwegian address requirement).

3. Call Altinn support to confirm which role(s) and delegation steps are required to submit A1 for a company, and whether a D‑number is sufficient.

4. Create a concise process map + checklist for two routes:
(a) Digital via Altinn (roles, step‑by‑step, screens, required docs).
(b) Postal (forms, where to send, cover letter, required docs, tracking).

5. Draft templates (Norwegian + English): POA text, employer confirmation letter, cover letter, email scripts to NAV, and internal checklist.

6. (Optional, if permitted) Test‑run one non‑binding application or fill the form to the last step to validate the workflow.

Must‑haves:
1. Fluent Norwegian + English; confident calling NAV.
2. Experience with NAV/Altinn processes (A1, membership, or similar).
3. Norwegian ID or D‑number with eID (BankID/MinID) if digital delegation is required.

When you apply, please tell us
a. Do you have a Norwegian ID or D‑number and can you accept Altinn delegation?
b. Have you dealt with NAV A1 or Altinn roles before? Briefly explain your approach.
c. Your proposed fee (hourly and/or fixed price for the deliverables above).
d. Your earliest start and availability this week.

Singapore Work-Pass Filing – 5-hour feasibility consult (Licensed EA or Immigration Professional)

## 6.2.3. Description
`P2D` ≔ 
```text
We need a quick, hands-on test to confirm that we can file Work Permit and Short-Term Visit Pass (business-visa) applications through the MOM portal. If the test runs smoothly, we’ll explore a longer-term partnership.

Your help (max 5 billable hours)

Time Task
1 h Screen-share session – Log in with your Singpass/CorpPass and show the step-by-step flow for starting a new application.
1 h Checklist – Give us a full list of the data fields and supporting documents required for both passes.
1 h Dummy submission – Using test data you provide, walk through one sample application while our engineer observes. (We’ll withdraw it right after.)
1 h Debrief call – Answer our questions about compliance and typical bottlenecks; highlight anything we should watch out for when we automate the process on our side.
≈1 h buffer Extra time for small follow-ups or clarifications.

What we need from you

✅ A valid Singpass that is linked to your licensed Employment Agency (please state your EA licence number).

✅ Recent experience — at least 50 MOM work-pass filings in the past year.

Deliverables

A short video or call recording of the walk-through.

The data-field & document checklist (Excel or CSV is fine).

A brief written summary of key compliance points.

Timeline

Complete everything within 7 calendar days of contract start.

Why this matters

This five-hour pilot lets us verify the steps with a real EA account before we invest further. If it works, we’ll discuss a formal, ongoing engagement.

(No need to know automation tools — our team handles all technical integration.)
