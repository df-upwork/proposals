1) I can do this in 2 hours.
2) Your website runs on Magento 2.4: https://www.customearthpromos.com/magento_version
The source code of the module for integrating your website with Doofinder: https://github.com/doofinder/doofinder-magento2
3) Judging by your screenshots, you just want to remove the labels from the color options.
4) The solution is obvious to me.
The simplest and my recommended way to solve this task is to hide the labels with CSS, shifting the underlying palette elements up by the height of the labels.
Most of the specified 2 hours will be spent on deploying your website on my workstation, rather than on the programming itself.
5) I have completed 536 projects (mostly Magento) here on Upwork.
