We take great pride of our 100% job success rate, built on years long business relationships with companies from all around the World. We have achieved this by having a great respect for each company and management culture, sharing their goals, adapting to any the environment and put the 100% of our efforts and expertise.

I offer this feedback to those considering a business relationship with them. Throughout our short tenure, we encountered numerous critical issues stemming from poor management, a lack of basic technical and professional knowledge required by the industry, questionable judgment, all of which led to an unproductive and tense working environment. Avoid this company if you don’t want to get entrapped in a toxic relationship.

From the very first day of our collaboration, it became evident that the company had neglected to properly configure essential aspects like SPF and DKIM for their email system. We provided guidance on rectifying these issues, but it was only the tip of the iceberg.

The company operates as a wholesale business but fails to maintain accurate records of orders missing their estimated time of arrival (ETA). Instead, they wait for customers to become angry and inquire about their orders, rather than proactively informing them about any delays.

Another alarming aspect we encountered was their peculiar order status called "pushed," where packed orders languish in the warehouse without being shipped until someone, after the customer complain, takes the initiative to intervene asking to stop ignoring those ready packages.

One of the most disconcerting experience, was of been presented this very singular theory that if the company didn’t have any problem, it would not need a customer service. We were reporting critical issues and plans to resolve or mitigate them, because that were the actions required to make the company’s customers happy, Massaging the communication is a minor part of the work and will work only in the short term. This perspective demonstrated a serious misinterpretation of the importance of customer satisfaction and the role of customer service in any business.

While we could compile a lengthy list of issues, the breach of our fiduciary agreement was particularly revealing. We trusted the company with services from multiple team members, covering various positions, to be billed under a single contract in Upwork with manual time logs. However, without prior notice or explanation, the client paused the contract on a Sunday, preventing us from logging time for the entire past week's work. This move not only undermined our agreement but also displayed a lack of professionalism.

Despite the challenges and toxicity we faced, we remained dedicated to maintaining customer satisfaction. Initially, we found the Customer Satisfaction rate at a mere 57.7%, but through our efforts, it rose to 86% by mid-July. Moreover, out of the few negative feedback received in July, a significant portion was from warehouse job candidates and not from customers, indicating a failure to treat prospective employees with respect and fairness.

While we possess the expertise to navigate such challenging environments, I must emphasize that subjecting oneself to a toxic work environment is not a necessity. We could have achieved our professional goals even in such circumstances, but I would caution others against seeking a partnership with this company. The issues run deep, and their lack of willingness to acknowledge and rectify their shortcomings may hinder progress and growth.

In conclusion, I hope this feedback serves as a candid account of our experience. It is crucial for any business to foster a healthy and productive relationship with its partners and vendors. Unfortunately, the company in question falls short in this regard, and I believe it is in the best interest of all parties involved to explore other opportunities that align better with their values and business goals.
