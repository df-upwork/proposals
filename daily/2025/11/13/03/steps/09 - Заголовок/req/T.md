1) While the problem manifests as mapping errors, the root cause is not merely isolated technical mistakes, but rather the probable fundamental inadequacy of the your client's Chart of Accounts (COA), which makes correct mapping impossible.
It is likely that this COA was taken from a standard restaurant template, and it structurally lacks the accounts necessary for an event venue business model.
The critically important revenue and liability accounts that are likely missing include:
- A liability account for deferred revenue (e.g., «2510 - Customer Deposits»).
- Key revenue accounts such as:
  - «4710 - Banquet Room Rental»
  - «4720 - Banquet and Catering - Equipment Rental - Net»
  - «4770 - Service Charges - Net»
  - «4103 - Catering/Banquet Revenue
2) The problem is most likely a direct consequence of a fundamental violation of GAAP.
The client receives prepayments (deposits) for future events.
It erroneously recognizes these deposits as revenue at the moment of receipt.
GAAP (specifically, the FASB ASC 606 standard «Revenue from Contracts with Customers») requires that revenue be recognized (earned) only when services are rendered.
Consequently, deposits must be accounted for as a liability until the event takes place.
Cash received before the services are rendered (e.g., a deposit for an event) is not revenue.
It represents «deferred revenue» and must be reflected on the balance sheet as a liability.
To comply with GAAP, the COA (discussed in point 1) must contain a liability account, e.g., «2250 - Deferred Deposit».
This account is specifically used to record «Deposits collected for hosted events for catering, space, etc.»
The Toast POS system has a specific feature to comply with this rule.
3) The operational tool used to implement the erroneous strategy described in points 1 and 2 is almost certainly the «Open Item» feature in Toast.
On-site operators, lacking dedicated menu buttons for «Room Rental» or «Event Deposit», use the «Open Item».
The configuration of this «Open Item» (whether default or administrator-applied) is static, meaning its assigned «Sales Category» or «Defer Revenue» status cannot correctly handle the variety of transactions it is being used for.
Consequently, when this feature is used for a purpose that contradicts its configuration (e.g., recording «Room Rental» through an item configured for «Food» sales), the revenue is routed to the wrong GL accounts.
4) The description of the problem suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the data flow hierarchy in Toast.
You are assuming a direct Item → GL mapping.
However, Toast utilizes a 3-tier hierarchy for standard revenue processing: Item → Sales Category → GL.
The actual technical failure occurs at the first level: the assignment of Items to Sales Categories.
The incorrect configuration of elements (especially the «Open Items» mentioned in point 3) is a major technical (not strategic) cause of the problem.
This includes their incorrect assignment to Sales Categories and the failure to activate the «Defer Revenue» setting.
5) A second, independent cause of the problem likely relates to bar menus, specifically concerning revenue from priced modifiers (e.g., alcohol upsells like «double» or «top-shelf»).
While this revenue is captured by Toast and included in overall sales totals, the handling of this data often leads to inaccurate financial reporting through 2 primary mechanisms:
5.1) The first mechanism concerns Sales Category attribution.
By default, Toast combines the modifier price with the base item price, attributing the total amount solely to the Sales Category of the base item.
E.g., an upsell to top-shelf liquor is incorrectly reported under the rail liquor category, distorting the revenue breakdown.
5.2) The second mechanism concerns the behavior of 3rd-party accounting integrations (e.g., xtraCHEF, RASI, QuickBooks connectors).
Many integrations fail to correctly process or map modifier data during the export to the GL, sometimes entirely ignoring this revenue even if it exists in the Toast report.
6) Summary
Your problem represents a cumulative result of 5 interconnected failures at the strategic, accounting, operational, and technical levels.
At the strategic level, the failure is the inadequate financial architecture described in point.
At the accounting level, the failure is the non-compliance described in point 2.
These 2 failures create the necessary conditions for your problem, making accurate financial reporting impossible in principle.
At the operational level, the failure is the flawed process described in point 3.
This process is the mechanism through which the strategic and accounting failures of points 1 and 2 are materialized in daily operations.
At the technical level, the failures are the configuration and data flow issues described in points 4 and 5.
