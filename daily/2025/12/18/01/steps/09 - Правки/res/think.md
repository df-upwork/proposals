3. A common misconception regarding `DSS𐏐` concerns the «$5,000 cap».
According to §212.054(2)(b)(1) `S⸙`, `DSS𐏐` applies only to the first $5,000 of the sales price of a single item of tangible personal property.
However, `S⸙` restricts this cap to tangible personal property, thereby excluding `R༄` by definition.
Consequently, `DOR` confirms that the limit is inapplicable to rental charges.
Rental charges are subject to `DSS𐏐` in full regardless of the invoice amount.

4. A valid overpayment scenario involves geographical sourcing errors.
`TDT𐏐` rates are tied to the specific location of the property.
Applying the maximum rate in `Qᨀ` across all properties causes systematic overpayment.
Outdated reference tables in `Qᨀ` often fail to reflect rate changes, e.g. those effective January 1, 2025.
If `L⌹` collected this excess from `Gꆜ`, `L⌹` must reimburse `Gꆜ` before claiming a refund to comply with `UE†` rules.

8. Some `Mᚖ` remit `SST𐏐` to `DOR` but do not collect county-specific `TDT𐏐`.
This partial collection creates a liability to the county.
A valid refund claim arises, e.g., if `L⌹` erroneously remitted `TDT𐏐` to `DOR` instead of the local tax collector.
Establish the evidence by reconciling `Mᚖ` reports with filed tax returns.
