### 2.2.
Ты ответил:
~~~
В контексте SaaS-систем или сервисных платформ «multi-tenant» (мультиарендная архитектура) означает, что одна и та же программная инфраструктура и код (одно приложение) обслуживают сразу несколько клиентов (так называемых «тенантов»). При этом каждый клиент или организация видит и управляет только своими данными и настройками, сохраняя конфиденциальность и безопасность, но технически все «тенанты» работают внутри одного общего программного окружения. 

Таким образом, «multi-tenant» система позволяет:
1. **Использовать единый экземпляр кода** для множества клиентов вместо создания отдельных экземпляров приложения на каждого клиента.  
2. **Разделять данные**: у каждого клиента (тенанта) свои базы (или логически разделённые схемы в базе данных), настройки и бизнес-логика (скины, тарифы, уровни доступа и т.д.), однако всё хранится в одной общей системе.  
3. **Упрощать обновления и техподдержку**: обновления кода и исправления ошибок делаются централизованно, что облегчает обслуживание, так как нет необходимости поддерживать несколько версий приложения для разных клиентов.  
4. **Масштабироваться**: ресурсы (серверные, сетевые) могут распределяться динамически между клиентами, что оптимизирует затраты и повышает эффективность.  

В контексте биллинга «multi-tenant» означает, что система должна уметь:
- **Вести раздельный учёт** транзакций, подписок, тарифов и выставления счетов для каждого «арендатора» (клиента).  
- **Управлять доступом** к платёжной информации: каждый клиент видит и обрабатывает только свои платежи и отчёты.  
- **Поддерживать разные модели подписок** и разные типы оплаты (включая международные платежи) в рамках одного приложения.  

Проще говоря, если вы представляете масштабируемую SaaS-платформу, которая обслуживает несколько компаний или групп пользователей под одной технической «крышей», то это и есть «multi-tenant»-архитектура.

#### History
Founded in January 2018, Woolf was established with the mission of increasing access to world-class higher education while ensuring that its qualifications are globally recognized and transferable.
With deep administrative investments in systems that monitor quality throughout the institution, Woolf has gained an expertise in launching innovative new programs for academics. Woolf has created over member 30 colleges to date and now launches one new college every month.

Founded by Dr. Joshua Broggi, then a faculty member at the University of Oxford, the institution continues in the venerable tradition of collegiate universities. Unlike traditional universities, Woolf’s administrative processes have always been digital, and the colleges are dispersed around the world, rather than located in a single town.

#### Why we are called Woolf
Woolf gets its name from Virginia Woolf, one of the great English writers of the 20th-century. Of particular inspiration, A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas, explore themes of academic freedom (especially for women), education as a means of professional and economic empowerment, and the outlines of a more perfect university.

These works highlighted the profound link between education on the one hand, and peace and prosperity on the other, and they exam ways to overcome conventions that oppress people and prevent  freedom and the full realization of one’s potential.

At Woolf, we work tirelessly to increase access to high quality education, often applying technology to obscure regulatory processes in order to support academics and students in their  pursuit of truth and learning.

It is in honor of Virginia Woolf’s visionary ideals and her advocacy for equality and empowerment that we bear the name Woolf.

#### Responsibilities and functions of QAETAC
The QAETAC is responsible for formulating adjustments to existing policies or their  implementation, delivering these recommendations to the Board of Directors, except where the committee determines that a vote should first be proposed in Council. This process ensures that all changes in policy are thoroughly vetted and aligned with Woolf’s overarching goals. To maintain a responsive and inclusive environment, QAETAC reviews student feedback gathered through on-going monitoring and periodic surveys. Student and faculty representatives are invited to join QAETAC meetings.

Additionally, QAETAC elicits faculty feedback twice per year. These surveys provide both students and faculty members the opportunity to make recommendations beyond the survey questions, ensuring their voices are heard and considered in policy-making.

#### Structure and governance
Woolf’s official QA Policy defines the structure of Woolf as a collegiate Higher Education Institution modeled on the University of Oxford and Cambridge. Each college within Woolf has the autonomy to admit qualifying faculty and students, while being equally governed by the central institution, which defines and enforces standards to qualify for admissions, teaching, and the curriculum. The QA Policy and the Quality Practices Policy are applied equally to all constituent members of Woolf, and all Woolf Faculty are equally members of the Faculty Council, of which QAETAC is a subcommittee.

The QAETAC plays a critical role in ensuring that the QA Policy is accurately encoded in Woolf’s software system, the Accreditation Management System (AMS). This technology alignment ensures that the institution’s high standards are consistently met and enhanced through software.

#### Committee composition and meetings
QAETAC is responsible for monitoring and improving quality across the institution. The Committee is composed of two Faculty Representatives elected by the Faculty Council from the membership of the Faculty Council; student input, which is invited by the Faculty Representatives on the basis of student surveys or student members; the Head of Institution (ex officio); the Secretary of Woolf (ex officio); and the Advisor for Equality and Diversity, appointed by the Head of Institution. The recommendations from the Committee are directly passed to the Board of Directors, except where the committee determines that a vote must first be proposed in Council. The committee holds regular meetings twice per year and extraordinary meetings once per month, at the discretion of the chairman of the meeting.

#### Woolf's regulatory and accreditation frameworks
##### 
All Woolf (MT) degrees are issued with ECTS credits. ECTS accreditation is the most sophisticated, widely recognized accreditation system in the world.
##### 
All Woolf degrees are listed on the European Union’s EUROPASS website, and all transcripts are issued with EUROPASS supplements to facilitate degree mobility.
##### 
Woolf degrees are recognized by more than 60 countries, including those who are under treaty obligation as signatories to the Lisbon Recognition Convention. The full list of signatory countries can be found on the United Nations website and the Council of Europe website.
##### 
The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) today comprises 49 member countries - more than just Europe. All the Higher Education Institutions in the EHEA use the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), providing a shared framework for accrediting courses and degrees.
##### 
The Bologna Process names the agreements which harmonize the accreditation standards of Europe. The process created not only the EHEA, but also the European Credit transfer System. Initially this was a system to transfer credits between institutions, and later it became the standard way to refer to the credits themselves, such as '90 ECTS credits'.
##### 
The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union. It is responsible for proposing legislation, enforcing EU laws and directing the Union's administrative operations, including education initiatives and policy-making. It oversees the ECTS system. All EHEA countries have adopted the European Standards and Guidelines (ESG 2015).
##### 
ECTS standards are validated by an approved local regulatory authority. Woolf is licensed by the Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA), which implements the ESG 2015 with the aim of further promoting quality in further and higher education.
##### 
Woolf is an official member institute of ICDE. The International Council for Open and Distance Education aims to transform the world through inclusive education, and is the leading membership organization working to bring quality educaiton to all.
##### 
Woolf is an official member of EDEN Digital Learning Europe. It exists to share knowledge and improve understanding amongst professionals in distance and e-learning and to promote policy and practice across the whole of Europe and beyond.
##### 
Woolf is an affiliate member of EURASHE, a European association promoting the voice of applied universities and representing over 600 higher education institutions.

ECTS standards, following the European Standards and Guidelines 2015 (ESG 2015) are validated by an approved regulatory authority.

The Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA), which is partially funded by the European Commission and European Union, implements ESG 2015 with the aim of further promoting quality in further and higher education. In September 2019, the Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA) (previously the National Commission for Further and Higher Education (NCFHE)) licensed Woolf as a degree-granting, accredited, Higher Education Institution. This license is recognized within the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and allows for transportability of higher education credits and degrees within the European Union. Malta is a member of the Bologna Process and the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Programs with ECTS accreditation via Woolf are specifically designated as such. In Europe, Woolf is a Higher Education Institution and is not licensed as a “university,” which is a specially reserved term. As a licensed Higher Education Institution, Woolf is able to offer bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees with the same status as issued by a “university.” Woolf expects to add the title of “university” (a matter of prestige but not accreditation) as it increases its publishing outputs.

### 3.5. Frequently asked questions
#### What is “Education Credential Assessment” (ECA) or degree recognition?
A process where a neutral party evaluates whether a degree in one country is equivalent to a degree in another country.
There are two kinds of ECA: assessment for academic purposes and assessment for immigration purposes.
#### What is “Education Credential Assessment” (ECA) for Academic purposes?
ECA for academic purposes evaluates the academic benchmarks of a degree in comparison with those in another country. For example, a Woolf master's degree has been evaluated by ECE.org to be equivalent to a US master’s degree. ECE.org has been a member of NACES.org since 1987.
Foundation for International Services, a member of NACES.org since 1987, has evaluated Woolf. FIS deemed a master’s degree from Woolf to be equivalent to one “from a regionally accredited institution in the United States”.
ECA for academic purposes is used for further study such as those seeking to pursue a PhD.

ECA for academic purposes is used for employment, and demonstrates to employment in a target country that a degree earned in another country meets their standards.
#### Has Woolf been evaluated with “Education Credential Assessment” (ECA) for Academic purposes?
Woolf (MT) has been evaluated by ECE.org, a non-profit body and member of NACES.org since 1987. ECE is authorised in the United States and Canada for ECA.
The institutional status of Woolf has been evaluated to be “Equivalent to US Regional Academic Accreditation.”
Program and credit evaluations of a Woolf graduate degree conducted by ECE determined that a “student will have the United States equivalent of a master’s degree recognition.”
ECA for Academic purposes typically take 5-10 weeks to complete.
#### What is “Education Credential Assessment” (ECA) for Immigration Purposes?
In some countries the government’s civil service evaluates degrees directly for immigration purposes, in other countries the government relies on third-parties.
Canada relies on third-party evaluators to perform ECA for both immigration and academic purposes.
Immigration evaluation consists of Academic Evaluation plus additional reviews (including primary and secondary school information). The time for a review is longer: 5-7 weeks for academic evaluation, but 10-30 weeks for immigration evaluation.
#### Has Woolf been evaluated with “Education Credential Assessment” (ECA) for Immigration purposes?
Yes, Woolf has been evaluated by non-profit, independent evaluators for purposes of academic equivalence and for Canadian immigration and citizenship. Comparative Education Services is part of the University of Toronto and is an authorized evaluation service for the Canadian government. CES reached the conclusion that a Woolf degree to be “from a recognized university” and CES accepted a Woolf master’s degree for purposes of immigration and citizenship.
#### Will a Woolf degree add points to my visa application?
Yes, a Woolf degree should help with immigration. Countries vary in their specific policies, but degrees issued by Woolf are fully accredited degrees.
#### Is there a difference between accreditation for online and offline degrees?
No, online and offline degrees have the exact same accreditation in Europe, there is no difference.
#### Will my master’s degree qualify me for entering a PhD program?
Yes, virtually all PhD programs require a master’s degree, and the degree will be recognized as a fully accredited degree from Europe and meet this formal qualification.
Ultimately, each PhD program has its own criteria, and the specific PhD advisor will often play a decisive role in the admissions process.
When selecting a PhD program, it is important that there is alignment between the subject of the master’s degree and the subject of the PhD.
#### Is my degree accredited in country X that I want to study in?
Your degree is accredited in Europe. Almost all countries in the world will recognize European accreditation.
For example, in the United States, ECE.org determined that a Woolf master’s degree is fully accredited from an American perspective and fully equivalent to an American master’s degree. Canada also determined a Woolf master’s degree to be fully accredited.
#### What is ECTS? What is the meaning of the MS degree being ECTS backed?
ECTS is the most sophisticated and globally recognized accreditation system.
It is the universal form of accreditation for the European Higher Education Area (49 countries have now joined).
All countries recognized it because it was recognized by a large block of Universities and Countries.
#### Can I check the validity of this program and that of Woolf on a government portal?
Woolf files programs with European partners operating under the European Standards and Guidelines 2015. You can find the MS degree, for example, listed on the official website of the Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA), which is co-funded by the Erasmus+ Program of the European Union – linked here.

#### Is Woolf a university?
n Europe, Woolf is a Higher Education Institution and is not licensed as a “university,” which is a specially reserved term. As an accredited, fully licenced Higher Education Institution, Woolf is able to offer bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees with the same status as issued by a “university.” There is no difference in accreditation of the degree issued, and Canada recognizes Woolf as a “university.”

Stats. § 440.52 (10)(a), with approval granted on August 15th, 2022 under the Educational Approval Program of the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services, which is the body providing state licensure for universities.
#### Degree Mobility for Indian Students
Woolf provides European-accredited degrees to students around the world, many of whom live in India. Woolf’s Indian alumni have already derived various benefits from their Woolf degrees, including improved status with employers and access to further study with Woolf and other institutions. They’re also used for immigration purposes in Europe, the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. However, there are important specifics about how the Indian education system relates to foreign online degrees which are important to bear in mind, as well as a number of misconceptions around the role of Association of Indian Universities (AIU) and University Grants Commission (UGC), two important institutions in the Indian context.

### 4.2.
Ты ответил:

**Короткий ответ**  
Бизнес Woolf (woolf.university) – это **аккредитованное высшее учебное заведение международного уровня**, работающее по «коллегиальной» модели (аналогично Оксфорду и Кембриджу):  
1. Woolf самостоятельно **предоставляет образовательные услуги** и выдает **аккредитованные (ECTS) степени** (бакалавриат, магистратура, докторантура).  
2. У Woolf есть **несколько «колледжей»** (каждый со своей академической специализацией и языком), все они находятся под центральной администрацией и QA-политиками Woolf.  
3. Woolf **получает доход**:  
   - **от студентов**, которые оплачивают обучение и получение европейски признанных дипломов;  
   - **от партнеров / колледжей**, которые присоединяются к экосистеме Woolf, используя его лицензирование, программное обеспечение и аккредитацию.  
4. Woolf также продает дополнительный доступ к своим **цифровым системам управления образованием**, обеспечивая университетскую инфраструктуру «под ключ» (подразумевается «multi-tenant» SaaS-модель).  

Ниже – более детальный разбор, кто и за что платит, а также какие услуги Woolf предоставляет.


---

## 1. Как Woolf зарабатывает деньги
### 1.1. Студенты оплачивают обучение и получают дипломы
- **Основная модель**: Woolf выступает в роли глобального вуза (Higher Education Institution), аккредитованного в Европе.  
- Студенты **платят за обучение** (tuition fees), могут получать **бакалаврские**, **магистерские** и **докторские** степени.  
- Woolf гарантирует, что все программы соответствуют европейской системе кредитов (ECTS) и признаны более чем в 60 странах.  

### 1.2. Колледжи платят за членство и доступ к аккредитованной платформе
- Woolf позволяет **различным «колледжам»** (которые могут располагаться в разных странах) действовать под эгидой аккредитованного института Woolf.  
- Колледжи получают:
  - **Доступ к инфраструктуре** и ПО для управления учебным процессом (Advising, QA, Accreditation Management System и др.).  
  - Право выдавать **европейски признанные** дипломы через Woolf.  
  - Поддержку в вопросах **регуляции**, **аккредитации**, **качества обучения**.  
- За это колледжи (или организаторы колледжа) могут оплачивать **лицензионный взнос**, **регулярную абонентскую плату** либо долю с дохода от студентов.  
- Такая модель называется **“мультиарендная” (multi-tenant) SaaS-платформа** для высшего образования, когда один провайдер (Woolf) обслуживает множество «арендаторов» (колледжей).

### 1.3. Другие возможные источники дохода
- **Корпоративные и партнёрские программы**: сотрудничество с компаниями или организациями, которые хотят предложить своим сотрудникам или клиентам аккредитованное обучение.  
- **Консалтинг** в сфере глобального высшего образования (процедуры аккредитации, ECTS, Bologna Process и т.д.).  
- **Технологическая лицензия** (В2В): когда сторонние образовательные платформы или вузы могут использовать программные решения Woolf для управления качеством, учебными планами, сертификацией и т.д.  

---

## 2. Кто и за что платит
1. **Студенты**:
   - Платят **обучение** (tuition fees).  
   - Получают **аккредитованную степень** (бакалавр, магистр, PhD) и возможность международного признания диплома.  

2. **Колледжи** или **группы учёных/преподавателей**, которые хотят работать под эгидой Woolf:
   - Платят **членские взносы** либо часть дохода от студентов (в зависимости от контракта).  
   - Получают **доступ к системе Woolf** для учебных курсов, QA-процессов, документооборота, выставления счетов студентам и прочего функционала.  
   - Используют **лицензию** Woolf как аккредитованное учреждение (с правом выдавать европейские ECTS-дипломы).  

3. **Организации** (правительства, исследовательские центры, фонды):
   - Могут финансировать или грантовать совместные образовательные инициативы, оплачивать обучение своих специалистов, покупать курсы для повышения квалификации.  
   - Woolf может получать часть финансирования через **международные гранты** (например, программы Erasmus+ в Европе и др.).  

---

## 3. Какие услуги Woolf предоставляет
1. **Аккредитованное высшее образование**: выдача степеней, соответствующих европейским стандартам ECTS и ESG 2015.  
2. **Коллегиальная структура**: подключение новых «колледжей» под единым «зонтичным» аккредитованным институтом.  
3. **Управление качеством** (QA): собственная система Quality Assurance, QAETAC, WAAC и пр., которые обеспечивают единые стандарты для всех колледжей и программ.  
4. **Цифровая образовательная платформа** (Accreditation Management System, AMS): 
   - Учёт студентов, их кредитов, оценок, посещаемости и т.п.  
   - Инструменты для ведения учебных курсов, расписания, контроля качества, сбора обратной связи.  
5. **Международное признание**: Woolf активно продвигает эквивалентность своих дипломов через ECE.org, NACES.org и другие структуры, что упрощает поступление на PhD в других странах или признание диплома работодателями.  

---

## 4. Резюме
Таким образом, **Woolf** – это **аккредитованная платформа для высшего образования** (со штаб-квартирой в ЕС и лицензией на выдачу дипломов), которая:  
- **Организует собственные образовательные программы** для студентов со всего мира (получая деньги напрямую через плату за обучение).  
- **Принимает в свою «экосистему» другие колледжи и программы** (фактически предоставляя им доступ к аккредитации, ПО и QA-политикам), взимая при этом плату за членство или часть дохода.  

Именно поэтому для Woolf важна **мультиарендная биллинговая система** (multi-tenant billing): один технологический стек Stripe Billing должен обслуживать несколько колледжей (тенантов), интегрированных в единую аккредитованную структуру Woolf, с учётом разных валют, моделей оплаты (seat-based, annual fees, SOW-based), локальных требований и пр.
