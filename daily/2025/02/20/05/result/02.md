The most likely causes of your problem are:
1) Some ports or server addresses may be incorrect. Several scenarios cause partial, rather than complete, packet loss:
1.1) A TURN server can listen on multiple ports and support various protocols (UDP, TCP, TLS).
If Netbird or the TURN client is configured only for some ports or protocols, certain checks (such as STUN or ICE) may succeed while other traffic (TURN relays or data channels) may fail or be misrouted.
1.2) The ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) mechanism, often used together with STUN/TURN, tries multiple connection options (UDP, TCP, IPv4, IPv6, some ports).
If some paths are misconfigured, ICE may switch to them when the main channel fails.
This can cause partial packet loss if ICE selects a wrong route or reverts unexpectedly.
1.3) When TURN is running, there is a control (signaling) stream and a separate data (media) stream.
If the signaling stream is configured correctly (for example, over TCP/443), but the data stream (UDP) is not, then the connection is partially established, and the actual traffic is lost.
1.4) A firewall or NAT may allow incoming packets on some ports while blocking the rest.
TURN tries to operate on multiple channels (especially under heavy load or multi-threaded connections).
Some of these channels may fail to pass through due to a mismatch of ports in the configuration.
1.5) A TURN server may have multiple A-records (e.g. IPv4 and IPv6), or only one specified, while the actual IP gateways differ.
If the configuration does not match (for example, specifying an IPv4 address in one place and a domain name resolving to IPv6 in another), the connection can split in two.
One part may go through correctly, while the other part goes nowhere.
2) The required port may not be open or may be partially blocked by the firewall/router, and some packets will be lost in transit.
There are scenarios where this leads to partial packet loss:
2.1) Similar to point 1.1: if the firewall allows, for example, TCP port 443, but blocks (or does not forward) UDP port 3478, then some of the packets will arrive (through the allowed channel), and others will be lost (through the blocked one).
2.2) There may be stricter limits or even dynamic filters for UDP traffic.
As a result, if some of the TURN traffic goes through a UDP port (and hits a limit or block), packets will be lost.
However, signaling or alternate streams (using TCP) may still work.
2.3) Some firewalls analyze traffic on the fly (stateful firewall/UTM) and may temporarily block or drop suspicious connections.
This does not always result in a complete disconnection.
Packets can be lost in waves: some get through, then some get dropped, and the connection can recover.
2.4) There are situations where NAT only opens one return-traffic window upon detecting the signaling stream (STUN requests, short keep-alive packets), but real data (TURN) requires additional ports.
These ports do not always open automatically.
As a result, the signaling channel appears connected, but most traffic is blocked.
2.5) In some configurations, only outgoing traffic is allowed on a specific port, and if the TURN server opens a different port/protocol for incoming traffic, that traffic is blocked.
This leads to a partially functional connection where some packets are sent, but incoming responses do not always arrive.
2.6) With incorrect NAT/Firewall settings, some test paths (ICE Candidates) may work, while others do not.
The client will periodically switch between different candidates, and if one leads to a blocked port, there will be spikes and packet loss rather than a complete disconnection.
2.7) Another service on the local network may use the same port, or the firewall may have a dynamic rule that blocks traffic under certain conditions.
This causes partial and unpredictable packet loss, for example once a certain volume of traffic is reached, the firewall may decide to terminate the session.
3) NAT/Firewall policies can degrade the connection (for example, by timeouts or excessive concurrent sessions).
4) Authentication may be not configured or invalid credentials may be specified.
This may lead to partial packet loss:
4.1) STUN may not require authentication or can use different parameters, while valid credentials are necessary for TURN relay.
4.2) Certain TURN implementations support a mechanism for temporary (short-lived) keys that require periodic refresh.
If these keys are invalid or expired, the server may initially pass a few packets and then disconnect or drop the session.
4.3) When using ICE (which tries multiple connection options), an ICE restart sometimes occurs, which is a repeated phase of establishing a connection with new credentials (login/password).
If authentication is misconfigured at that moment, some streams (before the ICE restart) may work while others fail.
4.4) The control channel (signaling, keep-alive, ICE checks) may use one scheme or port, while the main user traffic uses another scheme that requires authentication.
5) Traversing NAT directly (via STUN) can result in incorrect external addresses or ports.
Then the connection fluctuates: some packets use a temporary direct P2P connection, while others are lost, and the connection switches to the TURN server, causing interruptions.
6) If TURN lacks sufficient channel bandwidth (especially over UDP) or system resources (CPU, RAM), high loads can cause queuing and partial packet loss.
7) Netbird creates an overlay on WireGuard.
If there are route conflicts or overlapping IP addresses, some packets may get stuck or dropped.
8) When using WireGuard/Netbird, packets are encapsulated and thus become larger.
If the MTU is incorrect, packets may be fragmented or dropped.
This can cause partial loss, where smaller packets pass while larger ones disappear.
9) Behind a strict NAT, it is necessary to maintain the session with keep-alive packets.
If they are too rare, NAT can close the connection.
Some packets will be lost until the tunnel is reestablished.
10) Some routers/load balancers may lower the priority of UDP/VPN traffic or limit bandwidth. 
As a result, partial packet loss and latency spikes may occur, even though a normal ping (especially ICMP) appears fine.
