1) 3000 images are usually not enough for high-quality system training.
2) It is highly desirable to obtain more real data.
3) If obtaining more real data is impossible, then it is necessary to work seriously on data synthesis.
4) Nowadays, in addition to classical synthesis (data augmentation), it is possible to do synthesis via GAN.
5) Classical methods of synthesis: flips (Flip), rotations (Rotation), changes in brightness/contrast, noise, scaling, etc.
6) Stylized or color augmentations are useful to train the model to not get tied to a specific texture.
For example:
6.1) ColorJitter (random adjustment of HSV, gamma, etc.)
6.2) Blur/Sharpen (imitation of various focus conditions)
6.3) CutMix and Mosaic (mixing multiple images).
7) For cracks (or thin defects), instead of YOLO, methods based on segmentation (UNet, DeepLab) may work better, where labeling is done in the form of segmentation masks rather than bounding boxes.
