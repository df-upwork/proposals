You only uploaded the final certificate, but not the intermediate certificates.
Because of this, your certificate is not part of a chain of trust, and therefore external systems do not trust it («curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server»).
It is necessary to combine the final certificate and the intermediate certificates into a single file, and specify this file in the HAProxy settings.
