1) It seems that Tenant 1 does not have the necessary mechanism or process configured to automatically create (or sync) user accounts from Tenant 2. 
When the organizer from Tenant 1 tries to assign an invited user from Tenant 2 as a co-organizer, there is no guest record for that user in Tenant 1's Azure AD.
Therefore, Microsoft Teams cannot assign that user the permissions required for the co-organizer role because Teams relies on Azure AD (or the mapping in the local directory for the tenant) under the hood.
2) To resolve the problem:
2.1) Check the federation settings in Microsoft Teams.
2.1.1) Open the «Microsoft Teams admin center» in Tenant 1.
2.1.2) Go to «Org-wide settings» → «External access».
2.1.3) Make sure that the domain of Tenant 2 is present in the «Allowed domains» list, and that external interaction is enabled.
2.1.4) Do the same in Tenant 2, checking the «Allowed domains» list for the domain of Tenant 1. 
2.2) Configure Azure AD B2B Collaboration for Tenant 2 in Tenant 1  
2.2.1) Open the «Azure Active Directory admin center» in Tenant 1.  
2.2.2) Go to «External Identities» → «External collaboration settings».  
2.2.3) Enable «Guest access» and allow the sending of invitations to users from external organizations (it is possible to restrict by domain, adding Tenant 2 to the allowed list).  
2.2.4) If necessary, edit «Collaboration restrictions» so that the domain of Tenant 2 is included in the allowed list.   
2.3) Enable Azure AD Cross-Tenant Synchronization (optional if you require automatic synchronization)
2.3.1) In the «Azure Active Directory admin center» in Tenant 1, go to «External Identities» → «Cross-tenant synchronization (Preview)» (if it is available in the subscription).
2.3.2) Create a new synchronization relationship with Tenant 2, filling in the tenant identifiers and configuring parameters that allow for the automatic creation of user accounts from Tenant 2 in Tenant 1.
2.3.3) If necessary, specify the groups or all user accounts that need to be synchronized.
2.3.4) Save the settings and wait for the completion of the initial synchronization.
2.4) Invite users from Tenant 2 to Tenant 1 manually (an alternative approach without Cross-Tenant Synchronization)
2.4.1) In «Azure Active Directory admin center» in Tenant 1, go to «Users» → «New guest user».
2.4.2) Add the email addresses of users from Tenant 2.
2.4.3) Send them an invitation, and after the invitation is accepted, a guest account will appear in Azure Active Directory in Tenant 1.
2.4.4) Verify that the users are displayed correctly in «Users» → «All users» and have the status «Guest». 
2.5) Check the co-organizer role settings in Microsoft Teams.
2.5.1) In the «Microsoft Teams admin center» of Tenant 1, go to «Meetings» → «Meeting settings».
2.5.2) Make sure that in the «Roles» section, the option to invite users with the co-organizer role is not restricted to internal users only.
2.5.3) When creating a new meeting in Microsoft Teams (in Microsoft 365), check that the user from Tenant 2 (added as a Guest or synchronized) is available in the list and can be assigned as a co-organizer.
