4) «Do you have experience amending past tax returns or transitioning state filings cleanly to avoid penalties or red flags?»
Filing «Amended Returns» in `CA` creates a «red flag» as the modification of liability attracts scrutiny.
In `PA`, submitting past-due original returns through standard channels triggers automatic penalties for failure to file and pay.
The «Voluntary Disclosure Program» (hereafter — `VDP`) offers a guaranteed penalty waiver, unlike the uncertain petition based on «Reasonable Cause».
Eligibility is determined tax-by-tax, yet existing foreign registration typically disqualifies a corporation from `VDP` for corporate taxes.
Since August 1, 2023, the `VDP` look-back period for corporate taxes constitutes 3 years plus the current taxable year.
This limitation excludes collected but unremitted trust fund taxes, e.g. sales tax or payroll withholding.
