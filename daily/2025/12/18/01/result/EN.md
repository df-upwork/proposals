1) In points 3-9, I outline potential pitfalls in your situation.
In points 10-13, I outline my recommendations.
2) Key definitions used in my analysis:
Florida: `F᛭`
Florida's Department of Revenue: `DOR`
Florida Statutes: `S⸙`
QuickBooks Online: `Qᨀ`
State Sales Tax: `SST𐏐`
Discretionary Sales Surtax: `DSS𐏐`
Tourist Development Tax: `TDT𐏐`
Transient rentals: `R༄`
Marketplaces in the `R༄` sphere (Airbnb/VRBO): `Mᚖ`
Dealer (landlord) in `R༄`: `Dꆜ` (your role)
Consumer (guest) in `R༄`: `Gꆜ`
Unjust Enrichment: `UE†`
Voluntary Disclosure Agreement: `VDA`

3) Submitting an unsubstantiated or poor-quality DR-26S application to the `DOR` is guaranteed to trigger an audit that will uncover all violations and lead to penalties.
Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider all the pitfalls and recommendations described below.

4) The most common misconception regarding `TDT𐏐` concerns the limitation of the taxable base to the amount of $5,000 (the so-called «$5,000 cap»).
According to §212.054(2)(b)(1) `S⸙`, `TDT𐏐` applies only to the first $5,000 of the sales price of a single item of tangible personal property.
If a business sells equipment or automobiles, the tax is levied only on the first $5,000.
However, for `R༄`, `S⸙` makes a critical exception.
`S⸙` and `DOR` clarifications unequivocally state: the $5,000 limit does not apply to `R༄`.
Rental charges are subject to discretionary tax in full, regardless of the invoice amount.

5) There is a well-founded overpayment scenario related to the geographical sourcing of the rate.
The `TDT𐏐` rate is tied to the place of supply of the service (in this case — the location of the property).
If you used a single rate in `Qᨀ` for all properties (e.g. the maximum rate of 1.5%), but some properties are located in counties with a lower rate (e.g. 0.5% or 1%), then a systematic overpayment occurs.
Given the dynamics of rate changes (e.g. rate changes occurred in Hamilton, Marion, Martin, and Seminole counties effective January 1, 2025), the use of outdated reference tables in `Qᨀ` could have led to calculation errors.
In this case, a refund is possible, but it will require a detailed recalculation schedule for each transaction.

6) Under `F᛭` tax law, as in the majority of US states, `SST𐏐` and `TDT𐏐` are consumption taxes.
Although the legal obligation to remit the tax lies with the `Dꆜ`, the economic burden of the tax is borne by the `Gꆜ`.
The `Dꆜ` acts merely as an agent of the state collecting funds into a trust fund.
Consequently, if a tax overpayment occurred, then technically it was the `Gꆜ` who overpaid, not you.
If the state refunds the overpayment to the `Dꆜ`, and the `Dꆜ` retains these funds, `UE†` arises.

7) `DOR` has established strict barriers to prevent `UE†` of `Dꆜ`: «Sales and use tax dealers must first refund the customer before seeking a refund from the state».

For you, this requirement can create a most complex logistical and financial problem.
To claim a refund of overpaid taxes from the state, it is necessary to:
- Identify all `Gꆜ` for the past periods (within the statute of limitations — 3 years), for whose transactions the overpayment was made.
- Contact them and physically refund them the tax difference (e.g. 1% or 6% of the rental amount).
- Document each refund.
- Only after that submit a consolidated application to `DOR`.

If `Gꆜ` are unavailable, their contacts are lost, or bank cards are closed, you cannot simply keep the money for yourself.
In accordance with the unclaimed property legislation, these funds may be subject to transfer to the state under a different procedure, but cannot be recognized as `Dꆜ` income.

8) Since 2021, `Mᚖ` are required to automatically collect and remit taxes for `Dꆜ`.
However, many `Dꆜ`, continuing to use traditional accounting methods (`Qᨀ` in your case), out of inertia accrue and remit these taxes manually, creating duplicate obligations.
In this case, the overpayment occurs out of the pocket of `Dꆜ`, not `Gꆜ` (since `Gꆜ` paid the tax once — to `Mᚖ`).
Consequently, `UE†` does not apply here, and you are fully entitled to a refund without the need to contact `Gꆜ`.

9) Some `Mᚖ` (specifically, Airbnb) have agreements with the `DOR`, but do not have agreements with tax collectors of specific counties for the collection of `TDT𐏐`.
In such cases, `Mᚖ` collects `SST𐏐`, but does not collect `TDT𐏐`, leaving this obligation to `Dꆜ`.
This is the most promising basis for a refund.
The evidentiary basis here is built on the reconciliation of `Mᚖ` reports and your tax returns.

10) It is necessary to export full transaction reports from `Mᚖ` and data from the `Qᨀ` accounting system for the last 36 months.
The key task is to perform a three-way reconciliation:
- Tax amount withheld by `Mᚖ`.
- Tax amount recorded in `Qᨀ`.
- Tax amount actually paid according to DR-15 returns and county forms.

Identifying discrepancies will allow accurately classifying the type of error: duplicate payment (the most favorable scenario) or rate/jurisdiction error (requires a refund of funds to `Gꆜ`).

11) For cases of double payment, prepare a document package proving that `TDT𐏐` has already been paid by `Mᚖ`.
This eliminates the requirement to prove the refund to `Gꆜ`.
For cases of overpayment due to an incorrect rate — initiate the procedure of refunding the difference to regular `Gꆜ` or major tenants to form a basis for a refund claim.

12) Initiate the filing of form DR-26S via the electronic DOR portal for state taxes.
For `TDT𐏐` in self-administered counties — submit the corresponding local forms.
In cover letters, clearly state the legal basis for the refund, avoiding ambiguities that could trigger a full-scale audit.

13) An overpayment of tax to the `DOR` does not automatically offset an underpayment to the county, which risks penalties of up to 50%.
Therefore, it is necessary to verify the need for participation in a `VDA` to minimize financial losses before filing for a refund.
Using a `VDA` allows protecting your business from license suspension and the assessment of ruinous penalties by local authorities.
