1) I have created 26 open-sourced payment modules for Magento 2 myself, so I know everything about payment processing in Magento 2: https://github.com/topics/mage2pro-payment
My GitHub profiles: https://github.com/dmitrii-fediuk and https://github.com/mage2pro

2) I worked with CyberSource 8 years ago:https://mage2.pro/tag/cybersource 
Even then, their system looked very outdated.    
In recent years, CyberSource has been sustained by very large customers, e.g., certain airlines and government agencies of various countries.  
A company of your size («Mid-sized company (10-99 people)») might not be of much interest to them: they will work with you, but if you run into some specific problems, they are unlikely to rush to solve them.  
However, since you are in the financial sector, and if your turnover is really large — then it is possible.  
But in general, companies like CyberSource find it more profitable to build relationships with larger customers, for example by paying bribes to officials in some African countries to monopolize payment processing of utility bills, tax payments, fines, and so on.
