CBSA Anti-Dumping Reassessment Review & Import Compliance

## 2.3. Description
`PD` ≔ 
```text
I had a recent import of sofa beds from China into Canada that was reassessed by CBSA on Oct 15th that charged significant anti-dumping duties. 
I need an experienced Canadian customs/trade consultant to review the reassessment and determine if there is a realistic way to dispute or appeal it.

I also plan to import regular sofas and other furniture in the future and want guidance to ensure these products won’t fall under anti-dumping rules.

Seeking US customs broker for consulting

### 6.1.3. Description
`P1D` ≔ 
```text
I am Canadian e-commerce business. I want to ship my China made goods from my Canadian warehouse to Amazon FBA in USA. 
I want to consult with an experienced US customs broker to find the best solution for exporting my goods from Canada to Amazon FBA in USA.

My goods are watch bands. Some are made from leather, some nylon/synthetic materials and some from stainless steel.

A couple of my main questions are:

Would both the sender and receiver be my company?
Would the value that I declare for the merchandise be my cost price, or the price that I sell the items for on Amazon.com, or something else? (I am hoping to find a compliant solution where I would not be declaring value at the eventual price that my items would sell for at retail on amazon.com as the duties would likely be too expensive to make this a viable situation).

I want to research and discuss potential options to come up with the best sollution for my situation.

HTS Classification and Related Questions

### 6.6.3. Description
`P6D` ≔ 
```text
I am considering moving my warehouse and shipping operations from Canada to the USA and I have related questions to help my decision. 

My main products are watch bands. I want to determine the specific HTS codes for my watch bands and the applicable tax and duty rates to import them into the USA.

Leather watch bands - Made in China
Leather watch bands - Made in Spain
Leather watch bands - Made in Italy
Silicone watch bands - Made in China
Nylon watch bands - Made in China
Stainless steel watch bands - Made in China

What are the specific HTS codes and applicable taxes/duties for the above products to import them from China to USA?

Are all watch bands that are made in China part of section 301? Are there some that are not section 301?

Would assembling the buckle of the watch band and packaging the product in Canada effect the HTS code and tax/duty rate?

Would manufacturing the buckle of the watch band in Canada, assembling it to the watch band and packaging it all in Canada effect the HTS code and tax/duty rate?

I also have some questions about importing the inventory that I currently have in Canada to the USA.
