Most likely, your problem is caused by the `unattended-upgrades` package: https://github.com/mvo5/unattended-upgrades
Starting in 2024, this package has become more aggressive (I have solved this problem 5 times for different customers in the last year) because the Linux community is taking a stricter approach to vulnerabilities.  
For critical bugs or CVEs, patches are released faster and more frequently, and `unattended-upgrades` can install these updates immediately without asking for your opinion.  
The more patches there are, the greater the chance that something will go wrong during the upgrade process, especially if you have custom configurations.
