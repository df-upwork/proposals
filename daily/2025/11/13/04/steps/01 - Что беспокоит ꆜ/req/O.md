## 2.2. Title
RPA Engineer – Patient Registration Workflow Automation (Fixed Scope)

## 2.3. Description
`PD` ≔ 
```text
#
We are looking for an experienced RPA engineer to design and build an end-to-end automation that processes online patient registration submissions into EMIS, triggers GP2GP where appropriate, and produces clear exception logs for staff to review. 
The aim is a stable and well-documented workflow that can be used operationally by our team.

#
The work involves reviewing the current registration process, understanding each stage of the workflow, and producing clear technical design documentation. 
This includes mapping all registration fields, defining validation rules and exception conditions, and outlining how the automation should interact with EMIS. 
The GP2GP initiation logic also needs to be defined, including how eligibility is checked and how success or failure is confirmed.

#
The automation itself should combine desktop RPA actions with data validation steps. 
It should enter patient details into EMIS in a controlled, repeatable sequence, trigger GP2GP for eligible records, and generate structured logs that record the outcome of each attempt. 
These logs must clearly show success states, exception reasons, and timestamps so staff can easily review cases that need human intervention. 
Exception logic should cover scenarios such as mismatched information, missing required fields, or potential duplicate entries. 
Outputs should be provided in a readable format such as a CSV, shared sheet, or lightweight database.

#
Testing should be done using synthetic or anonymised data. 
The engineer will be expected to run full end-to-end test cases, resolve issues identified during UAT, and deploy the final workflow into our environment. 
Once the workflow is stable, the engineer should provide complete documentation, including an overview of the design and configuration, a runbook for day-to-day use, and guidance on monitoring and recovery. 
A short recorded walkthrough explaining how to run, observe, and troubleshoot the automation is also required.

#
We are looking for someone with advanced experience in RPA platforms such as UiPath or Power Automate, and who has a strong background in desktop automation using stable selectors and fallback patterns. 
The ideal person will have a solid understanding of validation logic, exception handling, retries, and structured logging. 
Clear technical writing skills are essential, as is experience working within controlled environments where sensitive data and compliance considerations are important. 
Experience with EMIS or other healthcare desktop systems is useful but not essential, and knowledge of UK healthcare workflows or GDPR requirements would be helpful.
