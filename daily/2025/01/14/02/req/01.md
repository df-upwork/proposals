Assistance with updating n8n installation on DigitalOcean with Docker
#### Description
We installed n8n on a Digital Ocean Droplet using Digital Ocean Apps. The app is now a few versions behind the latest version of n8n.
The Digital Ocean App uses Docker but was not configured with persistent storage by default. This means attempts to update the app wipe out the data.
First, we need help setting up the app's database to live outside the container so future updates do not break it. Once that is completed, we'd like you to update n8n to the latest version within Docker. We are using Proxy for the domain and SSL, which adds some complexity.
