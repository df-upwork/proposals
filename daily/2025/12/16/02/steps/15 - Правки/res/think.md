`MHᨀ` owns 100% of `MTᨀ` shares.
Dividends received from `U2ᨀ` qualify for the Participation Exemption, resulting in 0% corporate tax in `M᛭` without the need for a fiscal unit.

`𐒌(1)`, `𐒌(2)`
Both the Branch and the `U2ᨀ` structure provide robust protection against `U᛭` Estate Tax, as you hold shares in a non-US entity.
However, the Branch structure would likely incur a 15% Branch Profits Tax due to Treaty rate matching, resulting in a similar effective tax burden to the `U2ᨀ` structure.
Therefore, the `U2ᨀ` structure is preferable as it offers superior legal certainty and simplified banking compliance compared to a foreign branch.

The legal isolation of `CHᨀ` does not automatically prevent the creation of a `POEM` in `M᛭`.
To prevent `CHᨀ` from being deemed a tax resident of `M᛭`, you must ensure strategic decisions are demonstrably taken by qualified directors in `C᛭` and abstain from managing `CHᨀ` from `M᛭`.

Full legitimacy of using the Participation Exemption in `M᛭` combined with asset protection through a foreign jurisdiction.
