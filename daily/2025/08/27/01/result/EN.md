By August 2025, most of the listed Magento-related responsibilities can already be reliably automated, either partially or fully, using LLMs.
This automation will precisely achieve your desired outcome of «working independently and efficiently with minimal supervision».
I have conducted a detailed, multi-page, point-by-point analysis of the automation possibilities in the context of Magento for each of the 10 responsibilities you listed as of August 2025.
I have also published the analysis on my website dedicated to Magento: https://mage2.pro/t/6504
