В пункте **5.2.3** заменить текст на следующий:

```markdown
`MTᨀ` incorporates a US C-Corporation (`U2ᨀ`) to acquire business assets from `Uᨀ` at fair market value, subjecting profits to a flat 21% Federal Corporate Tax but eliminating the risk of the 30% Branch Profits Tax.
This asset purchase triggers an immediate Capital Gains Tax liability for `Uᨀ`, which must be budgeted as the unavoidable cost for effectively severing historical regulatory risks.
Dividends distributed by `U2ᨀ` to `MTᨀ` will be subject to a 15% Withholding Tax under the Derivative Benefits clause of the US-Malta Treaty, resulting in a total effective US tax burden of approximately 32.85%.

```

# 2.

В пункте **5.3.1** заменить текст на следующий:

```markdown
The C-Corporation structure caps the effective US tax burden at approximately 32.85% (21% CIT + 15% WHT), which is significantly more efficient than the 44.7% risk associated with a Branch structure (21% CIT + 30% BPT).
This approach provides legal certainty and banking access, avoiding the contradictions inherent in filing a «Protective Return» while actively trading.

# 3.

В пункте **5.3.2** заменить текст на следующий:

```markdown
The legal isolation of `CHᨀ` prevents the creation of a `POEM` in `M᛭` only if strategic decisions are demonstrably taken by qualified directors in `C᛭` and you abstain from managing `CHᨀ` from `M᛭`.
Given your current residency and active involvement, there is a critical risk that `CHᨀ` will be deemed a tax resident of `M᛭`, which would reclassify dividends as local income and nullify the `RB` advantage.
