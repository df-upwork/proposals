1) The primary reason (hereafter — `C1`) for your problem (hereafter — `P†`) is that Danish issuing banks (hereafter — `E`) decline payments because their fraud monitoring systems classify transactions as high-risk due to the sudden shift in your acquiring setup from a Danish entity to a US entity.
2) A critical contributing reason (hereafter — `C2`): Geoblocking on the cardholder side.
Many Danish banks (e.g., Danske Bank) allow customers to restrict card usage by region, often with default settings limited to «Europe Only».
Since your merchant country code is now set to the US, transactions are declined if the customer has not explicitly enabled transactions for «North America» or «World».
3) Your primary misconceptions:
3.1) «Nets is likely the acquiring bank»
This is incorrect: when using Shopify Payments in the US, the acquiring bank (hereafter — `A`) is Stripe or its American bank partner, not Nets.
3.2) «Whitelisting was applied by Nets»
It could not resolve `P†` for 3 reasons:
3.2.1) Point 3.1.
3.2.2) Codes `do_not_honor` and `59 (Suspected Fraud)` are generated by `E`, not `A`.
3.2.3) `A` (or any other participant) cannot force `E` to accept a transaction.
4) The technical reason (hereafter — `C3`) for `P†` (following from `C1`): the absence of 3D Secure (hereafter — `3DS`) authentication, which `E` expect as confirmation of the legitimacy of high-risk e-commerce transactions.
In your example of a failed payment, the log states: «3DS: Supported, not triggered».
This means that the platform (Shopify/Stripe) did not initiate authentication, although the card supported it.
`E` must comply with the PSD2 directive, requiring Strong Customer Authentication (hereafter — `SCA`) for e-commerce.
Although the transaction is «one-leg-out» (the acquirer is outside the EEA), European regulators require issuers in the EEA to make «best efforts» to apply `SCA`.
Many issuers interpret «best efforts» as a requirement for `3DS`, especially if other risk factors are present, such as the cross-border nature of the payment (`C1`).
The absence of `3DS` significantly increases the risk score, which can lead to the decline code `59 (Suspected Fraud)`.
The decline code `do_not_honor` is also often used by `E` when `SCA` is required but was not requested.
5) Below (points 6 and 7) are the main ways to solve `P†`.
6) Transition to the Merchant of Record (hereafter — `MoR`) model.
This is the most effective way: it solves `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`.
The Shopify Markets Pro service is available for this.
A Shopify partner assumes the role of the legal seller (`MoR`) for international transactions.
`MoR` processes payments through its local legal entities and acquiring accounts in Europe.
For a Danish customer, the transaction is processed as Intra-EEA instead of cross-border (Denmark → USA).
This automatically ensures compliance with PSD2 requirements for `SCA` and lowers the risk perceived by `E`.
7) Switching the payment gateway for the Danish market
7.1) Advantages
The method ensures full control over the `3DS` application logic, directly solving `C3`.
7.2) Disadvantages
7.2.1) 4 weeks ago, in your previous project posting, you mentioned that you use «recurring subscriptions» (hereafter — `RS`).
Migration of `RS` tokens between different payment gateways is often impossible, requiring customers to re-enter their card data.
7.2.2) Transactions remain cross-border, retaining a higher baseline risk.
