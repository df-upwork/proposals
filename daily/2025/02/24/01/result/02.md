The most likely causes of your problem:
1) Incorrect paths to static files (or even the base URL):
1.1) In development mode (`npm run dev` or `vite dev`) files are served directly from the dev server’s memory.
It understands that everything is located, for example, at `localhost:5173`, and your relative paths often work even without additional configuration (since everything is in a conditional root).
Moreover, in development mode Vite often «injects» paths on the fly, ignoring `base`, or adds HMR modules.
1.2) In production mode (`npm run build` or `vite preview`) files are minified and placed in the `dist` folder (by default).
Vite replaces links within the bundle with those specified in the `base` configuration.
If `base` does not match the actual deployment path, the browser will request files from incorrect URLs.
1.3) As a result, if the main JS bundle (or CSS) is not loaded, all frameworks and components will not be able to render.
2) In production mode the code is minified, and if a runtime error occurs (for example, when calling a contract method), the application may simply crash without an explicit message.
As a result, you will see a grey/blank screen.
3) Your Vite application may use different `.env` configuration files in development and production modes, and therefore the application may behave differently in these modes.
4) It is very common to use different Web3 providers in development and production modes, because writing and debugging smart contracts requires a fast, free and controlled environment, while in production a real Ethereum network is used.
4.1) In development mode, a contract is usually deployed to a local blockchain (Hardhat, Ganache).
Here, transactions are instantaneous, there is a default balance, and everything is controlled on one machine.
4.2) In production mode, the application connects to the real network (mainnet) or a public testnet (Goerli, Sepolia, etc.).
Real funds (ETH on the mainnet or test funds on a testnet) are required here, transactions take time, and contract addresses may differ from local ones.
4.3) If incorrect RPC URLs and contract addresses are used in production mode, Web3.js will not be able to connect to the network and may display a grey screen.
5) Different smart contract addresses can be used in development and production mode.
6) In a local Hardhat environment it is allowed to use a contract with any logic.
On the real network, this contract may not exist at all, or it may have a different ABI.
7) In the dev network (Hardhat/Ganache) transactions are free or the gas is conditional.
On the real network, the gas has to be paid for, and if the user's wallet is empty, sending a transaction will cause an error that, without proper handling in the code, can break the UI.
8) In the dev environment a local node is often used, whereas in prod it might be Infura or Alchemy.
If the Infura/Alchemy token is incorrect (expired, missing) during the prod build, RPC requests will return an error like `403 Forbidden` or `invalid project id`.
If this error is not handled in the code, it may crash and leave the interface unrendered.
9) Incorrect (too early or inconsistent) initialisation of MetaMask or any other Ethereum wallet in the browser can cause the application to crash and display a grey screen (or just a blank page) without an explicit error.
9.1) In development mode, MetaMask in the browser may manage to initialise `window.ethereum`, and the application code, even if it has errors, will still run.
9.2) In production mode, when the code is minified, split into bundles and loaded asynchronously, the initialisation time of MetaMask can shift.
If the application code requests `window.ethereum` before it appears, the application may crash.
