The most likely reasons for both problems occurring at once are:
1) When publishing a post (or saving content via AJAX in Elementor), the request may hang or be terminated by the WAF/firewall (e.g., Sucuri), causing a timeout, because when creating a post, WordPress makes a series of AJAX/REST requests that may be subject to strict rules (e.g., if the text of the post contains suspicious words or if the firewall does not trust certain data structures).
At the same time, the firewall may prevent Elementor from writing new CSS/JS files or remove some of the data during content updates, leaving an old version on the frontend.
When Elementor styles/layout are updated, files (CSS/JS) are generated and uploaded.
If a firewall blocks or filters this process, the changes will not reach the frontend.
2) Security plugins (Wordfence, iThemes Security, etc.) may cause a timeout when trying to publish a post (the plugin may perform a full scan or initiate a heavy process during the `publish_post` event).
Elementor changes will not show up because the plugin may be blocking or caching output, fixing HTML or JS code, or creating its own cache.
3) There may be a failure of the object cache (Redis, Memcached) or the server cache (Varnish, Nginx Cache).
When a new post is created, it triggers a series of requests to the database, and one of these requests may hang or return bad data from the cache, resulting in a timeout.
Changes made in Elementor will be saved to the database, but a cached (old) version of the page or styles will still be displayed on the frontend.
4) When publishing posts, WordPress attempts to create temporary files, save media attachments, and update the cache in the file system.
If the file permissions are set incorrectly, the process may hang or stop, resulting in a timeout.
Elementor creates CSS/JS files in `wp-content/uploads/elementor`.
If the file permissions are wrong, the changes cannot be saved, so the old version is displayed on the frontend.
5) When creating a new post, a long record lock may occur (especially when there are many revisions, large tables, or parallel queries).
This leads to exceeding `max_execution_time`.
At the same time, Elementor cannot correctly update (or quickly read) the template/style data in `wp_postmeta`, which causes the frontend to not display the latest edits.
6) If the website uses a master–slave scheme or another replication mechanism, there may be a delay or write error on publishing → timeout.
When content is updated in Elementor, requests may go to one node and be read by another (not yet updated) node - the changes will not be visible on the frontend.
7) Each time a post is created (or updated), custom logic may be triggered (complex hooks on `publish_post`, `save_post`, `wp_insert_post`): for example, requests to external APIs, importing or exporting large amounts of data, and PDF or XML generation.
This causes a long delay, resulting in a timeout.
Similar code can interfere with saving Elementor metadata or block updated styles.
8) When creating a post, a timeout can occur if there is a custom filter that overrides the content output, and that filter contains an error (for example, an infinite loop).
On the frontend, even after updating Elementor, old content may be displayed if the filter is hardcoded or returns cached results.
