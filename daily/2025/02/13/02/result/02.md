To implement your mockups in Grafana, the following development tasks are required:
1) Special right sliding panels (the `MP002-S`, `MP003-S`, `MP005-L`, `MP006-L`, `MP007-L` mockups).
By default, Grafana does not open such a detail panel when a user clicks on the table.
It only displays a popup for individual fields or offers a transition to another dashboard.
To implement such a sidebar as shown in the mockups, it is necessary to develop a plugin in React/TypeScript.
2) Special field types in the tables (battery icons, cellular signal, colored badges, «+200%», etc.).
It is also necessary to develop a plugin (React/TypeScript) to implement these features.
3) The scoring system (sum of metrics, percentages, and trends).
There are 2 ways to implement this system:
3.1) Calculate the score in the data source itself (InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, Prometheus). 
Then Grafana will receive the score metric already prepared.
3.2) Perform the aggregation on the Grafana side (Transformations).
If the data arrives as several metrics (temperature, pressure, vibration), I can:
3.2.1) Combine them into a single table (join / merge) using Transformations.
3.2.2) Add a «Calculated field» (a new Transformations feature in recent versions of Grafana), specifying a formula like `Score = Temperature × 0.3 + Pressure × 0.5 + Vibration × 0.2`.
3.2.3) Name the resulting field «Score».
3.2.4) For «+200%» (trend), I will have to either:
3.2.4.1) Do a «time shift» and another field – «Score (previous period)», then calculate `(score_current - score_previous)/score_previous * 100%`.
3.2.4.2) Use «Reduce / Moving average» and then compare past and present in one data set.
4) Associations:
- «Active Component» → «Associated Lubricator» (the `MP003-S` mockup)
- «Lubrication» → «Associated Components» (the `MP007-L` mockup)
A plugin must be developed to implement such associations.
5) Custom header/menu (Dashboards, Manage Outages, Insights, Account).
To implement such a custom header/menu, it is necessary to develop a plugin with its own layout (partial interface replacement).
6) Tabs on the right sliding panels (mentioned in point 1): e.g., «Analysis» in the `MP002-S` and `MP006-L` mockups, with graphs and a custom description.
To implement such tabs, it is also necessary to develop a plugin, in addition to the plugin mentioned in point 1.
7) Handling of the «RAISE WORK ORDER» and «APPLY CHANGES» buttons/links in the `MP005-L` mockup.
This also requires programming a plugin.
