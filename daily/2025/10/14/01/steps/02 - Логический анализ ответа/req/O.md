I have a successful Charter business in Chicago and I have a problem with reservations. 
There are three ways people can make reservations and book our Charters. 
Two are booking platforms that are nationwide. 
One is called to get my boat and the other one is called boatsetter. 
The third way they could book is directly on my booking site which I use an app called Greenstone.
Now all of these apps allow you to move the booking once you get it to either a Google calendar or possibly calendy so that all your bookings are in one place and you can see if you have double booked or have openings. 
The biggest problem is is that none of these three ways allow you to send your calendar back to them to block out time slots on each of the platforms. 
So you have to do that manually so if you get a booking and get my boat, you have to go into Green Stone and boatsetter and block out that time. 
If you get a booking on Greenstone, you have to go to get my boat and boat setter and block out that time. 
All this has to be done manually and it is very time-consuming. 
The apps don’t allow the other apps to talk to each other and none of them will upload Google calendar dates to block out certain times. 
No one in the charter industry has been able to figure out a way to automate this and as a result, many Charters get double booked and it creates a real bad customer service issue. 
In the new world of AI, there must be a way to solve this problem. 
Can you as an expert in advanced automation tell me how I could possibly solve this issue and maybe even build an app or a platform to be able to resell it as a subscription to the thousands of Charter wrote operators in the United States.
