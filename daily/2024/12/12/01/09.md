Since you indicated that your company is very small («Small company (2-9 people)»), it would be more cost-effective for you not to invest a large amount of money into developing such a solution from scratch, but rather to integrate one of the ready-made services: Prisync, Price2Spy, Competera, Boardfy, Minderest. 
 
These services immediately cover a number of critical tasks:  
1) Built-in mechanisms to bypass captchas and blocks: No need to develop your own parser or deal with anti-bot systems - these services do it for you.  
2) Convenient interface and analytics: Instead of creating your own dashboards and metrics, you get out-of-the-box tools for setting pricing rules, analyzing data, creating comparative charts, and generating reports.  
3) Automatic updates and scalability: No need to worry about complex infrastructure-the service updates data on schedule and scales as your workload grows.  
4) Save time and money: Instead of spending months developing your own solution, integrating an out-of-the-box service takes weeks, reducing costs and speeding time to market.  
How these services perform parsing and determine what data to extract from a given page:  
1) Manual configuration: You specify competitor URLs and the required page elements (price, title, SKU, etc.) using technical parameters (such as CSS selectors or XPath).  
This method requires an understanding of HTML structure.  
2) Semi-automatic (point-and-click) tools: Instead of manually entering selectors, you simply click on the desired elements on the page in a visual interface.  
The service identifies the technical parameters and periodically extracts the data.  
This simplifies the process and does not require deep technical knowledge.  
3) Predefined templates: For popular resources, the services already know where to find prices and other key data, greatly simplifying setup.  
4) Algorithmic or ML-based approach: More advanced platforms use machine learning to automatically detect and adapt to changes in page structure.  
If a competitor's site changes, the service will either notify you of the need to adjust settings or update the template itself (in the case of well-known resources).  

However, if you still prefer to develop a custom solution, I should mention that such development would take several months and would probably be impractical for the following reasons:
1) Significant initial development costs to create the parsing infrastructure  
2) Ongoing maintenance costs to keep the system running  
3) Regular updates required to keep up with changes to competitor sites  
4) Time and resources required to scale and optimize performance  
5) Ongoing effort to overcome anti-bot protection mechanisms
