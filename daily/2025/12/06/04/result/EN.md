1) In points 2-4 I address your 3 questions.
In point 5 I describe the optimal strategy to resolve your situation.

2) «Have you handled multi-state tax situations where a client lived in one state (e.g., Pennsylvania) but was still filing or registered in another (e.g., California)?»
Managing operations from a home office in Pennsylvania (hereafter — `PA`) establishes a taxable nexus.
This triggers Personal Income Tax or Corporate Net Income Tax liability.
It mandates compliance with Act 32 (Local Earned Income Tax) and registration for Employer Withholding.
15 Pa.C.S. § 411 requires foreign registration with the Department of State.

3) «Can you help determine whether a business should stop filing in California and start filing in Pennsylvania based on current operations?»
Operating from a home office in `PA` establishes a taxable nexus and mandates foreign registration in `PA` regardless of the status in `CA`.
Under the `CA` Revenue and Taxation Code (e.g., §17941, §23153), the minimum tax ($800, hereafter — `MT`) applies as long as your company (hereafter — `C`) remains incorporated, qualified, or registered.
This liability applies even if `C` is «Suspended» or «Forfeited».
`MT` accrual stops upon the effective date of a «Certificate of Dissolution», «Certificate of Cancellation», «Certificate of Surrender», or «Certificate of Conversion».
Therefore, merely ceasing to file leads to debt accumulation rather than valid legal termination.
If `C` is «Suspended», the Secretary of State will reject dissolution, cancellation, surrender, or conversion filings until the «Revivor» process restores good standing.
Only the effective date of formal dissolution, cancellation, surrender, or conversion definitively stops future `MT` accrual in `CA`.

4) «Do you have experience amending past tax returns or transitioning state filings cleanly to avoid penalties or red flags?»
Filing «Amended Returns» in `CA` raises a «red flag» as reducing reported liability attracts scrutiny.
In `PA`, submitting past-due original returns outside of `VDP` triggers automatic penalties for failure to file and pay.
The «Voluntary Disclosure Program» (hereafter — `VDP`) offers a guaranteed penalty waiver, unlike discretionary relief based on «Reasonable Cause».
Eligibility is determined on a tax-by-tax basis, yet existing registration in `PA` typically disqualifies a business entity from `VDP` for corporate taxes.
Since August 1, 2023, the `VDP` look-back period for corporate taxes is limited to 3 years plus the current taxable year.
This reduced look-back period does not apply to collected but unremitted trust fund taxes, e.g., sales tax or payroll withholding.

5) `R`: the correct way to solve your task 
5.1) Essence
5.1.1) `R1`: submit an anonymous `VDP` application in `PA` to resolve liabilities for past periods.
5.1.2) `R2`: verify `C`’s status in `CA` and complete the «Revivor» process if the status is «Suspended» or «Forfeited».
5.1.3) `R3`: execute «Domestication» into `PA` (15 Pa.C.S. § 371) followed by «Conversion» in `CA` (Corp. Code § 1157 or § 17710.02).
5.1.4) `R4`: for Corporations, publish the mandatory advertisement in 2 newspapers (15 Pa.C.S. § 1307).
5.1.5) `R5`: obtain local `PA` licenses, as interstate domestication does not automatically transfer permits.
5.2) Result
`C` becomes a `PA` domestic entity cleared of past penalties via `VDP`.
`CA` tax liability persists only if `C` exceeds economic nexus thresholds.
5.3) Advantages of `R`
5.3.1) For corporations, `R` qualifies as a tax-free Type «F» reorganization (IRC § 368(a)(1)(F)).
5.3.2) `C` retains the federal EIN and history, facilitating continuity for banking and insurance.
5.3.3) `R` terminates `CA` registration and stops `MT` accrual, provided `C` ceases «doing business» in `CA` under `CA`’s Rev. & Tax. Code § 23101.
5.3.4) `VDP` guarantees a 100% penalty waiver and limits the look-back period to 3 years plus the current taxable year.
